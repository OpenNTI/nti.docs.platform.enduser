Course Assignments
=============================================

Your assignments can be found in two different locations: the Lessons View and your Assignments View.

Lessons View
=============

Your instructor may post an assignment to a lesson. The assignment title will display along with the due date and a "Start" button to view and begin your assignment.

As you work through your assignment, your progress will be saved.

Click the “I’m Finished” button once you’ve answered all of your questions.

.. warning::  Once you select this button, you cannot go back and change your answers. This button submits your assignment for grading.

After you submit your assignment, you will have the option to leave feedback for your instructor. These comments are only visible to you and your instructor, and your instructor will be notified that you have left feedback.

Your assignment may be graded automatically upon turning it in, or you instructor may prefer to grade it manually. Either way, your grade will appear at the top right-hand side of your assignment and you will be notified through your notifications located under the bell icon in the upper right-hand corner.

Assignments View
================

Whereas the Lessons View includes all course resources and activities, the Assignments View only shows the assignments due for the course. There are three different tabs to reference your assignments.

Assignments Tab
----------------

The Assignment Tab lists all of the assignments in the course and allows you to filter assignments by Lesson, by Due Date, or by Completion. Green check marks will be displayed as you complete the assignments.

Grades and Performance Tab
---------------------------

The Grades and Performance Tab emphasizes information regarding your grades. This acts as a quick reference to determine your performance in the course. It displays the assignment, date assigned, date due, completion status, score, and feedback count. You can sort any of these by clicking on the title of the column.

Activity and Notifications

Activity and Notifications acts as an activity stream regarding your assignments. This is where you will be alerted of new assignments, a posted grade, a submitted assignment, feedback, and more.

Assignment Types
=================

There are a few unique assignment types you may encounter while progressing through your course.

Timed Assignments
-----------------

Some assignments may have a time limit. If an assignment is timed, you’ll see a time indication under the title of the assignment.

When you click “Start,” a window will display reminding you that you are being timed. 

   .. image:: images/timedassignmentview.png

Once you begin a timed assignment, the time remaining will be displayed for your reference in the upper right-hand corner.

   .. warning:: Please be aware the timer will **NOT** stop until you’ve clicked the “I’m Finished” button to submit your answers for grading. Once your time is up, the clock will then begin to count the additional time taken past the time allotted.

File Upload
------------

Another unique assignment is a File Upload. This assignment allows you to upload a file created within another program such as Word.

   .. image:: images/fileuploadassignment.png

When uploading your file, be sure to check the specs of the file such as the file type and size to be sure your file is compatible with the requirements on the assignment itself. Now, click the Upload button and choose your file. 

   .. warning:: To submit your file for grading, as with all assignments, you must click the “I’m Finished” button. Simply uploading your file does not submit your work for grading.

Discussion Assignment
----------------------

The discussion assignment prompts you to respond to a discussion prompt within the course forum.

   .. image:: images/discussionassignment2.png

As with all assignments, you will find this assignment type in your Lessons or Assignments View. Click Start. Within the assignment, you will be able to view the prompt. 

At the end of the prompt is a summary of your discussion activity, including how many comments you’ve contributed, how many comments you’ve responded to, and how many times your comments have been responded to by others. To respond to the prompt, click “Join Discussion” and the full discussion will display. Now, click “Add a Comment” to begin typing your response.
