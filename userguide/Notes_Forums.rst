Notes
======

Throughout your course, you’ll have the opportunity to make notes on almost any type of course material including readings, video transcripts, images, PDFs, surveys, and more. For most types of course materials, you can hover over the right margin for a note icon to appear, and click the icon to begin a new note. 

To bring up the annotation menu within a reading, drag your cursor over a passage. A menu will now appear with colored highlighter options as well as a note icon. Click on the note icon to begin a new note.

Notice, by default, the note is shared with everyone in your course. Remove this group if you wish to change your note’s audience. Type in the name of the person, group, list, or community with which you’d like to share your note, or simply leave the sharing field empty to keep the note private.

Add a title and a message and click "Save" to save and post your note. Once you save your note, notice that the note will appear in the discussion panel to the right of a reading. This panel contains all of the notes within the reading that have been shared with you, or that you have created. Notice also that in the margin of the text are blue numbers -- these numbers indicate the number of notes attached to the specific passage. To view only these notes, click on the number in the margin. Now, only these notes will appear in the discussion panel. Click the number once again to see all the notes reappear.

Styling, Whiteboard, and File Attachment
-----------------------------------------

While creating your note, you have options to style your text to emphasize words or phrases. Choose between bold, italics, or underline. You can also choose between adding a file to your note or even a whiteboard if the note is better displayed visually.

Image Markup
-------------

To markup an image, simply click the “comment” button under an image in a reading. This automatically places the image in your note, making it easy for you to markup the image and add text explaining your markings.
