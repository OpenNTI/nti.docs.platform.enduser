Course Videos
=============================================

You can find videos in a couple of different places. Primarily, you will see videos within the Lessons View as a single video, or a series of videos. You might also find a video within one of your readings.

This will play the video within your lessons. Notice that you have several options within the player to optimize your viewing. Adjust the videoâ€™s volume or video quality, and also add closed captions to your video.

Media Viewer
=============

You can also view the video in our Media Viewer. Instead of clicking the play button, click on the transcript button to the right of the video's title. The Media Viewer allows you to watch the video and the transcript simultaneously. Click on a section of the text to skip to that section of the video.

These transcriptions allow the video to be searchable by keywords or phrases using our search tools, and opens the door to powerful note taking and discussion tools. To start a discussion in the transcript, hover over the margin of your text and click the note icon. This will open a new note.

Notice the icons at the top right of the Media View.

This menu allows you to choose between Split Video (emphasizing the video), Split Transcript (emphasizing the script), or Full Video (which only displays the video). 

The left button allows you to navigate to the Video Gallery where you can view all the videos in your course. Click on one to begin watching.
