This view also allows you to watch the video and the transcript simultaneously. The text currently spoken will highlight within the transcript. Click on a section of the text to skip to that section of the video. As you scroll through the transcript, the video will follow.

These transcriptions allow the video to be searchable by keywords or phrases using our search tools, and opens the door to powerful note taking and discussion tools. To start a discussion in the transcript, hover over the margin of your text and click the note icon. This will open a new note.
