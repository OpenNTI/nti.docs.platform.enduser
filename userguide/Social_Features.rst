Social Features
=============================================

On NextThought, there are several tools available to leverage your learning network. Establish yourself by building your profile and adding contacts. Collaborate with your network by chatting in real time, setting up groups, and interacting on group and global community pages.

Your Profile
=============

Your profile houses your private and publicly viewable information as well as your activity stream.

About
------

The about tab allows you to edit your public profile, as well as update private information about yourself like your personal email. Click “Edit Profile” to get started. Once you are done making edits, click “Save” and view your public profile as others would see it.

Activity
---------

Your activity tab contains all of your social activity on the platform, including your discussions, notes, thoughts, and even your chat transcripts. These filters help you find activity you’re looking for. Other people can view your profile, but they will only see the activity that you’ve shared with them. In other words, they can’t view your private notes, chat transcripts, or any material shared outside a mutual course.

Navigate to your contacts page by visiting the chat bar located on the right-hand side of your platform and clicking on the contacts icon. If your browser window is smaller, this bar may be closed. If it is closed, you can open it by clicking on the chat icon in the upper-right hand corner.

Your Groups
============

If there is a group of individuals you regularly communicate with, consider creating a group on the platform to make communication quick and easy!

   .. image:: images/grouppage2.png

First, navigate to your contacts page and click on the tab labeled “Groups.” Click on “Create Group" and type a group name.

Select “Create” to create the group. Your contacts will need this group code to join the group. (Instead of clicking “Create Group” they will click “Join Group” and enter the code.)

Your group page is the meeting hub for its members! This page’s activity stream will display all notes shared with the group across readings and other materials, and allows members to post a discussion directly to the group page regarding any topic such as group meeting times, project ideas, and more. 

Your Communities
=================

While group pages offer a private meeting space for its members, the community page offers a public space for individuals to interact outside the context of a text or course. These communities are already set up by your organization or university, and can be located on your homepage, or from your memberships tab in your profile. Click on the community to view its page.

The community page offers members a space to post a topic or pose a question. It also displays course notes and forum posts shared to the community. Group members are located at the bottom left, making networking and communication easy.
