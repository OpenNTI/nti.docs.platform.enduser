Lessons View
------------
The Lessons View opens by default when you click on a course. To the left is a course outline that contains units and lessons. In each lesson, there are activities for you to participate in and complete. These activities may include videos, readings, discussions, and assignments. Click on an activity to begin, and work through each lesson in the order the materials present themselves.

Assignments View
-----------------
The Assignments View displays all of your course assignments. Although your assignments show up within your Lessons View, this view acts as a shortcut to view all your assignments in one place and offers extra information on grades, assignment due dates, feedback, and more.
