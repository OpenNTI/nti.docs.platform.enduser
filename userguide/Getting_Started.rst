four course views: “Lessons,” “Assignments,”
“Community,” and “Course Info.”

Lessons View
------------
The Lessons View opens by default when you click on a course. To the
left is a course outline that contains units and lessons. In each
lesson, there are activities for you to participate in and
complete. These activities may include videos, readings, discussions, and assignments. Click on an activity to begin, and work through each lesson in the order the materials present themselves.

Assignments View
----------------
The Assignments View displays all of your course assignments. Although
your assignments show up within your Lessons View, this view acts as a
shortcut to view all your assignments in one place and offers extra
information on grades, assignment due dates, feedback, and more.

Community View
----------------

The Community View is the place to
communicate and keep up with the course community. Channels appear to the left, and discussions appear within the channels. Both you and your facilitators can post to the channels available. In channels available to learners, you can post new discussions and respond to others. In facilitator-led channels, you won't be able to post new discussions, but you can respond to any listed. You may also see these discussions within your course Lessons View.
