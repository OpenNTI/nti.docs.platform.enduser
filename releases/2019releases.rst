Allow Multiple Attempts on Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Add Multiple Attempts:**

Instructors and Admins can now set the number of attempts a learner can take on an assignment. 

To set the number of attempts, select the “Options” button while editing an assignment, and scroll down.

.. note:: Both a value and passing score must be defined in order to add multiple attempts.

Choose between one attempt, multiple attempts, or unlimited attempts.

**Assignment Completion:**

Successful completion of an assignment can be defined as:

- **Submission Only** (Once the learner submits the assignment, the assignment is marked as complete.)
- **Passing Score** (The learner must gain a passing score.)
- **Excused** (If the facilitator excuses the assignment, the assignment will be marked as complete despite any other parameters.)
- **No Submit Grade** (A no submit assignment type cannot have multiple attempts. For no submit assignments, adding a grade will act as a “submission.”)

Multiple attempts can be added in order to allow the learner multiple attempts to gain a passing score, and thus multiple attempts for successful completion of the assignment. The displayed score on the assignment will be the highest score achieved of all attempts. Once the learner achieves the passing score or above, no more attempts will be allowed.

Enrollment Management in Course Roster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting ”Manage Enrollment” will open a window displaying all site users and a search bar. Search for learners within the search bar and select a learner.

After selecting a learner, the learner’s current course enrollment status will display. If they are not enrolled, you can select “Enroll User” to add them to the course.

If the learner is enrolled, the “Enrolled” text and course information will display. The enrolled user can be removed from the course by selecting the “Remove User” button.

**Advanced Enrollment Options**

Each site will have a defined set of user enrollment scopes. The “Advanced” dropdown will allow admins to enroll a learner into a specific scope.

For example, a university site may have two defined scopes: “enrolled” and “open.” By default learners may be enrolled into the “open” scope; however, using the advanced dropdown, and knowing the scopes allowed on the site, you can define the user as “enrolled” to enroll them in that scope.

.. note:: Please ask your project manager if you’d like to enroll a learner into a specific scope.

Add and Remove Group Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Site admins have the ability to add site users to a group.

After selecting “Create a Group,” you will be presented with a window to type a group name, and automatically add group members across the site. Select “Create” to create the group.

Calendar Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calendars will now notify the user when events are created or modified and are directly related to the user. The notifications will be sent on the platforms as well as by email. 

Passing and Failing Assignments Based on Scores
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assignments can now be set to pass or fail based on grade. The grade will be determined by the percentage of points earned in the assignment. 

To activate this feature on an assignment, open an assignment in edit mode. At the top of of the screen click on the “PASSING SCORE” field and click the checkbox labeled “Passing Score”. Enter the desired passing percentage to set the passing score.

.. note:: Please note, you must have the value field set for this feature to activate. If you do not, a prompt will direct you to set a value. 

Once you have saved and published the assignment, the learner can view the passing score requirement by opening up the assignment and viewing the top of the assignment for the newly designed field. The learner will now have to not only complete the assignment, but have a passing score in order to complete assignment and, thus, the course.

To use the Course Switcher, the admin should navigate to the desired course and then click the arrow beside the course name. The drop down menu will contain all other sections as well as other options such as a course visibility option, a delete button to delete the course and a link to edit the course information.
