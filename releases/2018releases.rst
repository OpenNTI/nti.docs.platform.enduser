--------------------------------------------------------

Student Participation Reports now display the duration of each video
within course lessons along with view sessions, total watch time,
average time/session, finished.

Use CSV File to Invite People to the Platform

by typing their emails. Now, a site admin can upload a CSV file with
listed email addresses to invite users to the platform.

.. image:: images/admininvitecsv.png

The CSV must follow this format:

Performance and Stability Improvements
--------------------------------------

General performance and stability improvements.

Forum Titles are Editable

of a forum. Now, admin and course facilitators can edit the title of a
forum.

.. image:: images/fourmtitle.png

Option to Automatically Require a Certain Content Type for Course Completion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, an admin, editor, or instructor had to require content
items one-by-one on the Lessons page.

Now, an admin, editor, or instructor can choose to automatically
require certain content types (e.g., Assignments). When that type is
added to a lesson, it will automatically display as “Required.” You
can still choose to manually require (or mark as optional) content
one-by-one regardless of the chosen setting.

1. Navigate to the Course Info tab.
2. Click “View Now” under the Advanced tools.
3. View the “Completion” tab.
4. Toggle defaults on or off.

.. image:: images/requirecontent.png


Assignments Automatically Required for Completion as Course Default
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, when a new course was created, all content types added to
a lesson would be “optional” for course completion by default.

Now, a new course will mark assignments as "Required" by
default. These settings can be changed by navigating to the Course
Info > Advanced tab and changing the default toggles.

.. image:: images/autorequired.png

Admin Tab Content Filtering and Sorting
---------------------------------------

Now, the titles of each column in the Admin Tools > Content tab will
filter and sort the courses and books by the respective field when
selected. (e.g., If you click on “Start Date” then the courses will be
ordered according to start date.)

.. image:: images/admintabfil.png


Library Filtering and Search
----------------------------

Previously, the course library (or homepage) was not searchable or
filterable. Now, you can use the search bar at the top of the window
to filter a course by course name or ID. To search, type into the
search bar. (Do not press the enter key.)

.. image:: images/librarysearch.png

Course Navigation Opens by Default when First Visiting Platform on Mobile Device
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To draw attention to the course navigation tabs, the first time a user
opens a course in the platform on a mobile device, the course
navigational tabs will be open.

.. image:: images/coursenavmobile.png

August 28th, 2018
=================

Open Courses from Catalog
-------------------------

An “Open” button now appears in the course catalog so that courses can
be immediately accessed and opened once enrolled. The “Remove” button
that once was in its place has been moved above it to the left.

.. image:: images/open.png

Invite Users to Join the Platform
---------------------------------

Site admin can now invite people by email to join the learning
platform (site) from the Admin Tools. Your invitations will be tracked
on the People tab, which will display pending invitations.

1. Navigate to your Admin Tools
2. Click on the “People” tab.
3. Click on “Invitations” subtab.

Select the red “cancel” button to the right of the user’s invitation
on the Invitations subtab.

New Design for Site Admin “Users” Tab
-------------------------------------

The “Users” tab has now been redesigned and renamed “People.” This new
design allows for easier use and simplicity, and contains a new
feature to invite users to the platform.

Here’s an overview of the new design:

.. image:: images/newdesign1.png

**New Sidebar**

Filtering users by role is now available in the sidebar and segregates
the users’ roles into two new tabs, “Learners” and “Admins.”

**User Information**

Now, join date and last active date appears to the right of the user’s
name and email. Clicking on the user still takes you to a detailed
user view.

**Change Role Relocation**

Now a “Change Role” button appears at the top right-hand side of the
People tab. When selected, a new flyout will appear prompting you to
change the role of the selected user. Click “Save” to change the role.

.. image:: images/newdesign2.png

**Invitations**

You can now invite people to join the platform.

Autofill Webinar Registration

already offered by the user on the platform (name, email, etc.) will
autofill in the registration form.

.. image:: images/autofill.png

August 16th, 2018
=================

Instant Email Notification for Replies to Post
----------------------------------------------

When someone replies to
your post, you'll now receive both an instant email regarding this
notification as well as an in-app notification. Daily or weekly
notification emails are still sent out, and will still include items
in one-off notification emails.

August 9th, 2018
================

Short Answer Question Type can be Objective or Subjective
---------------------------------------------------------

Previously, the short answer question type was an objective type that
was auto-assessed for correctness. Instructors were required to define
the correct response(s) for short answer questions. Now, instructors
have the option to provide a solution or offer no solution. If no
solution is provided, the question is assumed to be subjective and is
no longer auto-assessed for correctness.

August 6th, 2018

NextThought now integrates with GoToWebinar to allow learners to view,
register, and join webinars from their Lessons page. Admin can

Restrict Assignment Submissions Based on Due Date

Course Instructors now have the ability to restrict submissions to an
assignment by due date and offer a grace period or timeframe for their

     by a defined amount of time. Then, define the amount of time
     you'd like to allow.

5. Click the “Done” button to save your changes.

.. image:: images/restrictedsub.png

window will appear stating that the assignment is past due and cannot
be submitted.

course. Deleting the code will not affect current learner enrollment.

Required Resources

certain course materials as “Required.”

When a resource is marked as “Required,” a label will appear next to
the content on the Lessons page.

Course Completion and Progress
------------------------------

Assessing course progress has become much more streamlined, visual,
and comprehensive in this feature release.

**Progress is defined by a learner completing required materials.** In
 order for a learner to complete required materials, materials must be
 viewed (video, PDF, readings, etc.) or submitted (survey,
 self-assessment, assignments).

Progress can be viewed by instructor, assistant, admin, and learner
accounts.

**Learner View**

Users can view their course progress on the Lessons page in the upper
left-hand corner.

.. image:: images/learnerprogress2.png

Learner “Progress” displays

- the number of items remaining (i.e,. the number of required items
  not viewed/submitted), and
- the percent of the course completed (i.e., items remaining divided
  by total required items).

.. image:: images/learnprogress.png

**Facilitator View**

Similar to the learner, facilitators and admin will also see the
progress icon in the upper left-hand corner on the Lessons page.

Facilitator/Admin “Progress” displays

- the number of learners who have completed the course (i.e., the
  number of learners who have viewed/submitted all required material),
  and
- average class completion (all learner completion percentages added
  and divided by the number of learners).

.. image:: images/facprogress.png

Instructors, assistants, and admin have an additional, more detailed
view of progress per learner. Navigate to your “Course Info” page and
click on the Roster.

In the roster, the progress of each learner is presented.

Click on the progress icon to view a detailed report. The report
presents a closer look at how the learner is progressing through the
course item by item. The top of the report presents how the learner is
performing compared to his/her colleagues. Learners are sorted into 1
of 5 categories depending on their progress. All required items are
listed, and if a learner has completed that item, it is marked as
completed with the date.
