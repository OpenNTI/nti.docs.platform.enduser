Can I access courses on my smartphone or tablet?
------------------------------------------------

Courses are accessible using the web browser on your smartphone or tablet. 

Can I participate without an Internet connection?
------------------------------------------------------

To participate, you will need to have access to a broadband Internet connection of 1Mb/s+ for optimal video viewing and navigation. All course content including videos, readings, discussions, and quizzes are located on the platform. Videos are hosted by Kaltura, YouTube, Vimeo, or other streaming video services. 

What if I'm having issues logging in?
--------------------------------------

Please make sure you enter the correct username and password. If you have forgotten either of these, click “I forgot my username or password” at the bottom of the login page. If you continue to have issues, email support@nextthought.com.

I forgot my password. What do I do?
-----------------------------------

If you have forgotten either your username or password, click “I forgot my username or password” at the bottom of the login page. You will receive an email with the necessary steps to log in. For your security, the emailed link to change your password expires one hour after it is sent.

Can I delete my account?
--------------------------

This step cannot be undone. If you desire to delete your account, please email support@nextthought.com with the subject “Account Deletion Request.” Please note, it may take up to 48 hours to delete your account. After your account has been deleted, you will no longer have access to your notes, discussions, contacts lists, progress, etc.

Can I download my course materials to be viewed offline?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Course content such as videos, video transcripts, readings, timelines, quizzes, and tests are only available with an internet connection while logged into your account. Some course content, such as PDFs and other files attachments, are available for download to your personal computer or device. 

What if I’m having trouble viewing course videos?
------------------------------------------------------

There are several scenarios that may interfere with streaming videos on the platform, including your connection speed, browser extensions, and video player. 

If your connection speed is good, and you do not have any browser extensions conflicting with the video player, you can reach Support at support@nextthought.com.

How do I change my email address?
------------------------------------------------------

In order to change your email address, please first log in to your account on NextThought. Then, click on your profile image in the upper right-hand corner of your browser window and click “View Profile”. This will navigate you to your profile page. While viewing the “About” tab, click “Edit Profile" in the upper right-hand corner. Change your email address to your preferred email, and click "Save.” This will change your email on file. You will then be sent an email with a link to verify your email.

How do I change my display name?
------------------------------------------------------

Your display name is located within your profile information. To edit your profile, first navigate to your profile by clicking on your profile image in the upper right-hand corner. Then, click “View Profile.” While viewing the “About” tab, click on the “Edit Profile” button in the upper right-hand corner. 

Find your “Display Name.” You will either be able to type into the field to change your name or you will need to click the edit icon to the right of your name. If you can type into the field directly, type in your new display name and then scroll to the top of your profile and click "Save." If you cannot type into this field, click the edit icon. This will open a Request Name Change form. In the form, be sure to type exactly how you would like your name to be displayed, not just the part of your name you’d like to change. Once finished, click “Submit” to submit the form for approval. Once your name has been changed, you will be sent a confirmation email. 

How do I unsubscribe from emails?
------------------------------------------------------

The best way to ensure that you do not receive future emails is to click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email itself. 

Please note that there are different types of emails you can receive from NextThought including promotional emails as well as emails that alert you to important notifications you received (e.g., a reply to a note) while you were away from your account. Because a user may desire to opt out of one type (promotional) while still receiving others (notifications regarding important activity on their account), these will both need to be unsubscribed from if you desire to not receive any type of email from NextThought. 

Additionally, you may receive emails from your instructor or course. You will need to drop the course if you wish to no longer receive emails regarding your coursework.
