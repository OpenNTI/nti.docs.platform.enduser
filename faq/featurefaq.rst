How do I make a highlight in my text?
------------------------------------------------

Drag your cursor over the desired passage, and a toolbar with blue, green, and yellow highlight options will appear. Choose a color for your highlighted text and your highlight will save.

How can I create and share a note?
------------------------------------------------

To create a note while in a course reading, highlight a selection of text by dragging your cursor over the desired passage. A toolbar will appear with three colored highlight options and the add note icon. Click on the note icon to create a note. Additionally, you may also hover your mouse in the margin to the right of the text and click on the note icon that appears. You can create notes in readings, the Media Viewer next to video transcripts, as well as in self-assessments.

While creating your note, there are three sections to type in: “+Add people to the discussion,” “Title,” and “Type a message.” By default, notes are typically shared with all people in your course. To change who your note is shared with, begin typing a contact, list, or group name in the sharing field and click on the name to add them to the note. To remove a person, group, or list, hover over their name in the sharing field, and an “x” will appear. Click the x to remove. If no one is listed in the sharing field, the note will be private and only you can access it. Add a title or simply just a message to your note. You may also click the paperclip icon to add a whiteboard or file. Click “Save” to save and post your note.

Can everyone see the note I just made?
------------------------------------------------

You control who is able to see your note. By default, notes are typically shared with all people in your course. To change who your note is shared with, begin typing a contact, list, or group’s name in the sharing field and click on them to share. To remove a person, group, or list, hover over their name in the sharing field, and an “x” will appear. Click the x to remove.

How can I change who my note is shared with?

If no one has yet commented on your note, you are able to change the sharing preferences. To open your posted note, click on the note in the discussion panel to the right of your reading. Now, select “Share” at the bottom of your note to view the sharing menu. Hover your mouse over the contact or group you’d like to remove and click the “x.” To add a contact or group, begin typing their name in the field that says “+Add” for sharing suggestions to appear. Click on the correct contact or group to add them to your note. Click the “Save” button once you have the correct contacts or groups in which you’d like to share your note with. Your new sharing preferences will be saved to your note, and any contact or group removed will no longer have access to the note.

How do I delete a note or comment I created?
------------------------------------------------

First, click on your note in the discussion panel to the right of the reading to open your note. While viewing your note, click on the “Options” icon at the bottom left-hand corner of the note. A drop down menu will appear. Click on the “Delete” option. Your note will now be deleted and no longer accessible.
