Options for opening a course
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three options for site admins when opening course content to users. These options are available when creating a course, or you can return to this view by hovering over a course on the homepage and clicking the gear icon that appears. Then, select "Edit Course Information" and "Course Settings."

- **Preview Mode On:**
  This option sets the course to course preview mode, meaning that users can only view Course Info but cannot view course content.
  
- **Preview Mode Off:**
  This option allows the course to be fully available to users.
  
- **Based on Start Date:**
  This option sets the course to be in course preview mode until the defined start date and time, at which time it will then become fully available to users.
