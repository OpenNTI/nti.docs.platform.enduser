Admin tools for site management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NextThought offers a new role, the site admin, alongside a suite of new tools and reports to create and manage courses, view site-wide analytics, mangage users, and view user analytics. For site admin accounts, the toolbar is located in the upper right-hand corner of the homepage.

Please see the new Site Admin Guide to learn more! (Coming soon.)

New course catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new course catalog retains the same purpose, but offers new visualizations, better navigation, a search field, and course categorization. The new course catalog displays a featured courses banner, and all public courses display below. Courses can be organized into categories based on course tagging. A new tab, the "History" tab, allows users to review their enrolled courses.
