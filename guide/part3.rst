PART III: Create an Assignment
==============================

Introduction
============

The assignment authoring tool allows you to create an assignment for
your course and place it within a lesson. Add an assignment to a lesson
to assess your students’ knowledge of the material they are learning.

 |image75|

Overview
=========

There are several options available for customizing an assignment. This
allows you to create a unique assignment tailored to your needs.

-  **Question Types:** You are able to create assignments with several
   different assessment types such as essays, file uploads, free
   response, multiple choice, multiple answer, and ordering.
-  **Other Options:** You can choose if the assignment will have a time
   limit or not, when the assignment is scheduled and due, and how many
   points the assignment is worth. More advanced options include who can
   view the assignment (all students or only for-credit), if it is
   autograded, if the order of questions and answers are randomized, and
   if a different selection of questions will appear for each student.

Create an Assignment
====================

The following steps will guide you through the process of creating an
assignment. 

Below are the steps for assignment creation. Each step is explored in
full below.

#. Locate “Create” assignment button
#. Assign the due date, time limit, and point value (optional)
#. Title your assignment and write a description
#. Add, edit, and order questions
#. Explore assignment “Options” (optional)
#. Publish or schedule your assignment
#. Add assignment to a lesson

Step 1: Locate “Create” assignment button
-----------------------------------------

Locate the button to begin a new assignment.

There are two options to begin a new assignment:

- **Assignments Page:**

  1. To begin creating an assignment, first enter the course in which you’d like to place the assignment and view the assignments page.

  2. While viewing the assignments subtab, click on the blue button titled "Create."
   
  3. After you click this button, a new assignment template will open.

- **Lessons Page (Edit Mode):**

    |image78|

   1. While viewing your lessons page in Edit mode, select a lesson and view a section within the lesson.
   
   2. Click the “+Add content” button at the bottom of the section.
   
   3. Then, select “Assignments.”
   
   4. In the assignment edit popup window that opens, select the blue “Create Assignment” button. Creating an assignment from this view will add the           assignment to this specific section in the course upon creation.

Step 2: Assign the due date, time limit, and point value
--------------------------------------------------------

Decide upon the essential elements of the assignment. Please note, these
categories are optional.

 |image79|

Below are the descriptions for each option:

Due Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The due date defines the date and time the assignment should be completed by.

  |image80|

.. note:: **How it works:** In the Lessons Page and Assignments Page, the assignment due date will display next to the assignment’s title. Once the assignment is past the due date, students will still be able to take it, but the assignment will be marked as late upon submission. Once the due date passes, the solutions to each question will display after the student submits his or her assignment.

.. note:: **If not selected:** If no due date is selected, the assignment will be marked as “Available” and students are welcome to take the assignment when convenient.

Time Limit 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding a time limit to the assignment will alert the student upon opening the assignment that he or she only has a defined amount of time to complete the assignment once started.

 |image81|
 
|
 
 |image82|
 
|

.. note:: **How it works:** The time limit will be displayed next to the assignment’s name on the Lessons or Assignments tab, and when the assignment is selected, the student will first be alerted to how much time they have to take the assignment and that once started the timer will not stop. Once the student begins the assignment, a countdown clock will display at all times in the upper right-hand corner. The timer will continue until the student submits his or her assignment. Once the timer reaches 0 when counting down from the allotted time, the timer will then count up displaying how many seconds/minutes/hours the assignment is over time. In other words, the student will be able to interact with the assignment past the time limit, although the assignment will be marked as over time upon student submission.

.. note:: **If not selected:** If a time is not allotted to complete the assignment, a student is welcome to work on it as long as needed without being penalized for time.

Value
^^^^^^^^

The value allows you to assign the amount of points the assignment is worth. This point value will display in bold font to the right of the assignment's title in student’s Lessons page and the Assignments tab.

 |image83|
 
.. note:: **How it works:** The assignment's total value will display next to the name of the assignment on the Lessons View and Assignments View. In their Assignments View, their grade will be listed as [Earned Points/Total Points]. If you choose to set the assignment to autograde, the total points will determine the value of each question.
 
.. note:: **If not selected:** If a point value is not assigned, no point value will display. An instructor can still assign a grade once the assignment is submitted by students.

.. warning:: Please note, in order for the assignment to autograde, you must assign a point value and also click on the “Options” button and check the “Enable Auto Grading” box. This means, when the student takes the assignment, the assignment will be checked for correctness and assigned a visible grade for the student’s work. We will explore this option more in Step 5 below. Also, if you are using the Grade Predictor feature, you must assign a point value.

Step 3: Title your assignment and write a description
-----------------------------------------------------

Add a title and description by typing in the
appropriately labeled fields.

 |image84|

The students will see the title of the assignment within their lesson
and within the assignment’s tab. The description will display once the
student opens the assignment and may be used for further explanation or
instructions regarding the assignment.

Step 4: Add and Edit Questions
---------------------------------

 |image85|

Add Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add questions to your assignment by clicking on a question from
under the “Types” panel on the right and dragging a question type into
the correct placement within your assignment, or click once on a
question type to place the question at the end of your assignment. You
may reorder these questions after placed.

Edit Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Once you have added a question type, you will need to add text.
Most questions will have a field for the question text and a field for
the answer text (with the exception of the essay type and file upload types). 
To edit any field, click in the field and begin
to type. On most question types, you can add extra solution
possibilities by clicking on “Add a choice.”

To learn more, see Question Types.

 |image86|

.. warning:: Please note, if you add a Short Answer question type, your answer text must exactly match the spelling of your student’s solution for the question to be marked correct.

Order Questions 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To reorder your assignment’s questions, click on the dotted box
in the upper left-hand corner of the question and drag your question
into place, or select the up or down arrow to the right of your question
to move it one place at a time.

You may also reorder the answers within the question itself. To do so,
click on the dotted box icon to the left of your solution and drag the
answer to the preferred location within the solution set and drop your
answer into place.

Duplicate Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 |image88|
 
Duplicate the question to create a second identical question
within your assignment to edit as needed. Click the square icon to the
right of your question to duplicate the question.

Delete Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 |image89|
 
Click the trash can icon to delete the question entirely from
your assignment. If you’ve made a mistake by deleting the question, you
will have a small “undo” menu that appears momentarily at the bottom
left to restore the question.


Step 5: Explore assignment “Options”
------------------------------------

 |image90|

The Options tool allows you to choose who can see the assignment, if
your assignment is auto graded, if ordering of questions or answers is
randomized, and if you’d like to set a max limit of questions that
present to the student.

To view and edit advanced settings, click the “Options” button to the
right of the assignment’s title. Below is a description of each option:

Assign to Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

This option allows you to select who can view the assignment.

 |image91|

.. note:: **How it works:** You can make an assignment visible to either “Everyone” or “For Credit Only.” If it’s assigned to “For Credit Only” only students that are taking the course for credit may see the assignment and interact with it.

Grading Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By enabling auto grading, the assignment will be automatically graded according to the answers you’ve marked as correct.
You must have an assignment value set in order to auto grade. (See Step 2 regarding value.)

 |image92|

.. warning:: **How it works:** Each question will share an equal amount of points counting toward the total value of the assignment. (Although, NextThought can set up an assignment to grade with different point values per question. Please contact NextThought if you are interested.) 
After the student submits his or her assignment, each question will be marked as correct or incorrect and display the student’s score based on number of correct answers and how much each question is worth. The instructor will also be able to view the student’s score and answers.

.. warning:: Please note, that if you have added a file upload or essay question type, auto grading will no longer be available to you since neither of these types can be automatically graded. Also note that all assignments will be “auto-assessed” regardless if they are auto-graded. Auto-assessed means that each question upon submission will be marked with either “Correct” or “Incorrect.”

If you plan to edit an assignment to autograde that wasn’t previously
autograded, or if you plan to edit or delete the point value associated
with an autograded assignment, please see “Editing Point Values and
Autograde Option” within the section titled "Edit or Delete an
Assignment" for more details.

Randomize Ordering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting randomize will help ensure that each
student have a unique quiz while still displaying each question and
solution.

 |image93|

**Randomize Question Order:**

Selecting this option will randomize the order in which the questions
are presented to each student.

**Randomize Answer Order:**

Selecting this option will randomize the order in which the answers are
presented to each student.

**Max Limit:**

 |image94|
 
Setting a max limit of questions allows a designated amount
of questions from a larger set of questions to be randomly selected and
assigned to students. Students will only be able to see and interact
with their unique set of questions.

In other words, if you have 40 questions for the assignment, and you set
a max limit of 10 questions, each student will have 10 questions
randomly selected and presented to them from the 40 possible questions
on their assignment. These 10 questions will make up that student’s
unique assignment.

Step 6: Publish or schedule your assignment
-------------------------------------------

Once you have completed creating your assignment, the last step is to
publish the assignment and place it in a lesson. |image95|

**Publish:**

Click on the “Publish” button at the bottom right-hand corner of your
assignment. This will open a new window displaying the options
“Publish,” “Schedule,” and “Draft” (the current state it’s in). If you
want to publish your assignment and make it available right away, click
“Publish” and then “Save.”

**Schedule:**

If you’d like the assignment to be scheduled to become
available, click “Schedule” and select the day and enter a time for it
to become available for students. Before this date and time, students
will only be able to see the title of the assignment and the date it
becomes available. They will not be able to view the assignment’s
contents. Once the assignment becomes available (or if it was
immediately published) the student may take the assignment. |image96|

If you aren’t quite finished with the assignment, that’s okay. You can
leave it as is without publishing it and return to it later. It will be
saved as a draft. For instructions about returning to an assignment, see
the section "Edit or Delete an Assignment."


Step 7: Add assignment to a lesson
----------------------------------

There are two ways in which to add assignments to your lesson.

While Viewing your Assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While viewing your assignment, you can add your assignment to a lesson.

#. Above the title of the assignment, click on the blue text that “Add
   to Lesson.” A new sharing window will appear that lists where the
   assignment is currently placed, and lists the current lessons, both
   drafted and published. |image97|
#. Now select the lesson you’d like to place the assignment in by
   clicking “Add to lesson.” When you select this, a pop up menu will
   allow you to select a section within the lesson to place the
   assignment. |image98|
#. Select the section(s) in which you’d like to place the assignment.
   The lesson will now be listed at the top of the sharing window.
#. Now, click “Done.”

.. note:: You will notice that “Add to Lesson” has been replaced with the name of the lesson in which the assignment is shared to. Click on this again to add or remove the assignment from a lesson. You can also add it to multiple lessons.

 |image99|

While Viewing a Lesson
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While viewing a lesson, you can add your assignment to a lesson.

#. Click on the “Edit” at the top right-hand corner of the lesson. This
   will enter the editing mode. 
   
#. Now, find the section in which you’d like to place the assignment and
   click “+Add Content.” (This text appears at the bottom of each
   section within a lesson while in Edit Mode.) This will open the
   content menu. |image100|
   
#. In the content menu, select “Assignment.” |image101|

#. Next, find your assignment within the list of assignments, click on
   it, and then click “Select” in the bottom right-hand corner.

   .. warning:: If you do not see your assignment, you may not have set it to be published. Return to your assignment and publish the assignment. Please see the section "Edit or Delete an Assignment" to find out how to return to your assignment.

 |image102|

5. Now select “Add to Lesson” in the bottom right-hand corner to add it
   to your lesson.

 |image103|

.. note:: Please note, if you do not place an assignment in a lesson, published assignments can still be viewed by students within their Assignments tab.

Edit or Delete an Assignment
==============================

You can return to an assignment to complete it, make necessary changes,
or delete the assignment entirely.

To return to an assignment to edit or delete it:

#. Click on the Assignments tab and view the Assignments subtab. This
   will list all assignments in your course both published and drafts.
   
#. Now, click the blue text “Edit” to the right of the assignment’s name
   to view it in editing mode.

 |image104|

Editing Assignments
-------------------

Depending on the state your assignment is in some editing options may be
limited. Use the descriptions below to understand your limitations:

1. **If the assignment is in draft currently (or scheduled for a future date), you are not limited to the edits you can make.**

  As you edit the assignment, your edits will be saved automatically as
  you go. Please make sure you are finished editing your assignment before
  the scheduled date at which point the assignment will be “published” and
  viewable.

2. **If the assignment is published, but no student has yet interacted with it, you are not limited to the edits you can make; however, you will be required to save some types of edits manually instead of the application saving changes automatically as you go.**

  Any edits to published questions (or adding new questions) will open the
  question in a new pop-up window. Once you have made changes to that
  question and are satisfied with its presentation, click the “Save”
  button to publish the new version of the question at once and continue
  editing.

  |image105|

  Other edits such as toggling different Options, moving the order of the
  questions, deleting questions, adding a time limit, as well as adding a
  due date will be saved automatically when the change occurs.

3. **If the assignment is published, but students have begun the assignment, you will be limited in the edits you can make.**

  In this scenario, only minor changes can be made such as textual changes
  in question or answer text or in the assignment title and description.
  You may also assign a new value to the question, select a new answer, or
  assign a new due date or scheduled date. 

  (Please note, if the assignment
  is set to autograde and you assign a new value to the assignment, the
  assignment will be regraded according to the new value for those
  students who have already taken the assignment. Also, if you assign a
  different solution than previously selected, the assignment will regrade
  and reassess accordingly for those who have already submitted their
  assignment.)

  If you need to make larger changes such as adding a question, deleting a
  question, and toggling different Options, you will receive an error
  message in the bottom right-hand corner and will be prompted to Reset
  student assignments in order to save the changes. Resetting the
  assignment will clear all student submissions and students will have to
  retake the updated assignment.

4. **If the assignment was not created using our authoring tools,** the assignment will be referred to as a “Legacy Assignment” and is limited to two types of edits, point value and autograde changes, regardless if students have begun the assignment or not. You can add, delete, or edit point values, and you have the option to turn autograde on or off by clicking the “Options” button and selecting the enable autograde option. Please see “Editing Point Values and Autograde Option” below for more details. |image106|

Editing Point Values and Autograde Option
-----------------------------------------

Within all assignments, regardless if students have begun the assignment
or not, you have the option to add, delete, or edit point values, and
turn autograding on or off. Please click “Edit” next to the assignment’s
name in your Assignments tab to enter Edit Mode. The point value is
located in the upper right-hand corner, and the autograde option is
listed within the “Options” button.

FAQ when editing autograde and point values:

-  There are some assignment types that can't be autograded (such as an
   essay). If this type of question exists within the assignment, it
   will not allow you to select autograde, although you are still
   welcome to add a point value.
-  If you choose autograde, all previously completed assignments should
   now autograde according to the point value you just defined.
-  If you choose autograde, all assignments taken after will also be
   autograded accordingly.
-  If you turn off autograde on an assignment that was previously
   autograded, any student’s assignment that was autograded will remain
   graded. In other words, their grade will not be deleted.
-  If you define a NEW point value with autograde already selected, the
   assignments will RE-AUTOGRADE according to the new point value (both
   previously completed assignments and assignments completed after the
   change).
-  If the assignment is MANUALLY GRADED by the professor, the manual
   grade will OVERRIDE any autograde settings for that student’s
   assignment. In other words, if a student’s assignment was graded by
   the professor and given “90 points” and then set to autograde, the
   “90” points will persist even if the autograde function would grade
   the student differently.

 |image107|

Deleting Assignments 
----------------------

To delete an assignment: 

1. View the assignment in editing mode. 

2. Select the publish button at the bottom right. (If students have begun taking the assignment, you will first be presented a Reset button. You will need to reset student progress before proceeding.)

3. Now, click the “delete” button. A window will now appear to confirm deletion.

 |image108|

Copying or Sharing a Question to Another Assignment
===================================================

Overview
--------

The question sharing features allows you to take one question from an
assignment and place it into another assignment. This can be useful when
creating cumulative tests: perhaps you’d like to take one question from
each quiz in the course and create a test from those questions.

Terms:

-  **Share:** Sharing a question refers to the same question being 
   "shared" over multiple assignments. By sharing, any edits to the
   question, regardless of location, will apply the edit to all
   locations.
-  **Copy:** After you share a question, you have the option to “detach” the
   question from other locations so that question edits are not shared
   across locations. Detaching a shared question essentially makes a
   “copy” of the question and places it in a new location. 

Before we get started, please note:

-  **Editing:** When you edit a shared question/answer, on either
   assignment, it will edit the question/answer set in both places.
-  **Editing Limitations:** You might be limited to what you
   can edit on the question if an assignment it was shared with has been taken. 
   For example, if a quiz and cumulative exam share a question,
   and the students have taken the quiz, then from within the exam you
   will only be able to select a different solution (e.g., from “A” to
   “B”), or make minor text edits. You will not be allowed to delete
   solutions or reorder solutions. (If you do choose to select a new
   solution, the previously taken assignment will regrade according to
   the new solution in the question).
-  **Copy vs. Share:** If you wish to only make a copy of the question and
   place it in another assignment (and not “share” the question to where
   edits will affect both places), you do have the option to “detach”
   the shared question once you’ve placed it into another assignment. We
   will go over this below.

Sharing and copying a question:
-------------------

You can share a question between multiple assignments.

1. Navigate to the Assignments tab, and click on the Assignments subtab.
Now, click “Edit” to the far right of the assignment’s name. This will
open the assignment editing mode.

2. Now, find the menu to the right of a question, and select the
ellipsis symbol. Select “Share with Other Assignments” to open the
question sharing window.

 |image109|

3. The sharing window will display the assignments the question is
currently shared in, and also all available assignments. By default, the
current assignment the question is contained in will be listed in the
“Shared To” list.

 |image110|

4. Select “Add to Assignment” to the right of the assignment in
which you’d like to add the question. When you add a question to an
assignment, the question will be added to the end of the assignment.
(You can rearrange the questions within the assignment itself.) The
assignment will now be added to the “Shared To” list.

 |image111|

5. Click “Done” to exit the sharing window. Notice the question now
displays “Shared” to indicate that it is a question being shared to
another assignment. |image112| If you choose to, you can detach the shared question from each other by
hovering over the question and selecting the text that appears “Detach
from Other Assignments.”

If you choose to detach a question, the question functions as a copy and you are free to make edits without it affecting the same question
in another assignment.
