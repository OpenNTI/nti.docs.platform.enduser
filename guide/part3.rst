Gradebook Organization
================================================

The Gradebook is organized into three sections:  “Assignments,” “Grades & Performance,” and “Activity and Notifications.”

Assignments Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Assignments section displays an interactive list of all assignments
in your course.

.. image:: images/assignments.png

You can sort this list by lesson, due date, completion, publication
status, and creation date. Searching for a specific assignment is easy
with the search tool.

.. image:: images/sortLesson.png

Click on an assignment within the list to view specific learner
activity. You can sort the list of students by name, username,
completion, score, and feedback by selecting that column’s title. You
can also filter by enrolled and open students, and search for specific
learners by name by clicking the enrolled/open student dropdown.

.. image:: images/studentActivity.png

Click “View Assignment” to view or practice the assignment. If the
assignment included a file upload, a download files button will be
available to you to download all learner files to your computer.

.. image:: images/viewAssignment.png

You can also "Edit Assignment" as well as change the due date.

.. note:: When more than 50 learners are in the course, learners are filtered by page in the Gradebook. To display more learners per page, click the gear icon located in the upper right-hand corner.


Grades & Performance Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Grades & Performance section displays an interactive list of all
learners in your course.

.. image:: images/gradesPerformance.png

This section allows you to view a detailed list of “All Students,”
“Enrolled,” or “Open.” Clicking on the column titles will sort by
student name, username, projected grade, or (if available) final grade.
You also have the option to sort learners by their assignment status
(actionable items, overdue items, and ungraded items) by using the top
dropdown.

Click on the email icon to email the course or a subset of learners.
Click on the download button to export course grades. 

Clicking on a learner from this view allows you to view that learner’s
assignment submissions and grades. You can sort the learner’s
assignments by name, completion status, score, and feedback. Grade any
assignment by clicking in the score column, and excuse or reset a grade
using the dropdown. View the learner’s “Profile,” or click on “Email” to
email the learner. Click on a specific assignment to view the student’s
work.

.. image:: images/studentAssign.png

.. note:: When more than 50 learners are in the course, learners are filtered by page in the Gradebook. To display more learners per page, click the gear icon located in the upper right-hand corner.


Activity & Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Activity & Notification section is the go-to place to see all
important updates and notices relating to assignments.

Assignment notifications are organized by date, with the most recent
activities near the top of the stream. Clicking on a notification will
navigate you to that activity.

**Instructor Notifications Include:**

-  Learner submission
-  Learner feedback
-  Instructor feedback

.. image:: images/instructorNotifications.png

**Learner Notifications Include:**

-  New assignment
-  Overdue assignment
-  Assignment submission
-  Learner feedback
-  Instructor feedback
-  New grades
-  Posted final grade

.. image:: images/studentNotifications.png

.. warning:: Please note: Due to the large amount of activity generated in instructor accounts, learner submission notifications will only appear in the Activity & Notifications section of the Gradebook and will not appear in your general notifications located within the bell icon in the upper right-hand corner of your account. Learners, however, will continue to receive important notifications such as feedback or an assigned grade in both streams. To learn more about the general notification stream, please visit the guide’s “Notifications” section.

Grading Assignments
================================================

Instructors may add or modify a grade, reset and excuse assignments, and
leave feedback.

Adding a Grade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grades can be added within the Learner View or Assignment View.

Once you have added a grade by typing in a numerical or alphabetical value, the
grade will automatically save.

Grades can be manually or automatically assigned. If an assignment has
concrete answers (as opposed to essay questions), you can enable
automatic grading. This feature would assign an automatic and viewable
grade upon completion of the assignment.

.. note::  Please note: An instructor can modify an automatic or manual grade at any time by clicking on the grade and typing in a new value.

   dropdown menu located under “Assignment Grade” in the upper
   right-hand corner to reset or excuse a grade.

Leaving Feedback
================================================

Both instructors and learners can leave feedback on assignments. Once a learner submits his or her assignment, or the assignment is
graded, a feedback option appears on the assignment for both the learner
and instructor.

.. image:: images/leavingFeedback.png

**In order to leave a learner feedback, follow these steps:**

#. View a learner’s assignment. (To review how to open a learner’s assignment, see the section titled
   “Adding a Grade” above.)
#. Click the “Add a comment” textbox at the bottom of the
   assignment.
#. Type your feedback or upload a file and select “Save” to add feedback
   to the assignment. This will notify the learner.

.. note::  Please note: If a learner leaves you feedback on an assignment, you will be notified in the “Activity & Notifications” section of your Gradebook. To navigate to the feedback, click on the activity notification.

Grade Predictor
================================================

.. image:: images/gradePredictor.png

The grade predictor displays for both learners and teachers and allows
the learner to estimate his or her end of the year course grade. Please
let NextThought know if you are interested in making this feature
available.

The grade predictor predicts the course grade of the learner based on
the total points available and the total points earned by the learner.
In other words, the grade predictor takes the learner’s currently earned
points and divides by the currently available total points of
assignments. This creates a percent between 0% and 100%.

**Location:**

-  For the learner, the grade predictor will be available in the
   learner’s “Grade & Performance” tab under “Course Grade.”
-  For the instructor, click on the “Grades & Performance” tab.
   Learners will have a “Projected Grade” column.

.. note:: For additional specifications regarding the grade predictor, please contact NextThought.

Final Grades
================================================

Within the Gradebook, instructors can add final course grades. If you
are interested in this feature, please contact NextThought.

Assign a final grade by navigating to the Grades & Performance section
of the Gradebook. Add a number grade or a letter grade for each learner
under the column titled “Grade.” Alternatively, add a final grade by
selecting a learner’s name. This opens a list of the learner’s course
assignments and individual grades. Enter the final grade at the top
right-hand corner under “Course Grade.” The learner will receive a
notification and will be able to view his or her final grade. 

Downloading Student Files
================================================

Download learner files directly from your Gradebook.

When an assignment includes the option for learners to upload a file,
you can download a learner’s submitted file(s) by navigating to his or
her assignment and selecting the blue “Preview” button within the
assignment download section.

You can also download all learner submissions for one assignment into a
folder on your computer. In order to do so, follow the steps below:

.. image:: images/downloadingStudentFiles.png

#. Navigate to the “Assignments” section of your Gradebook.
#. Click on the assignment name.
#. To the far right of the assignment’s name is a download files button.
#. Click the download button to download student files to your computer.

.. note:: These submissions will be saved in a zip file (typically in your Downloads folder) with the assignment name and course section number. Each learner submission within the zip file (“[CourseID][[Assignment Name]”) will be saved as “ [Learner Username]-[Learner First and Last Name]-[Title of Submission].” 

Exporting Grades
================================================

Export the Gradebook into a CSV file.

.. image:: images/exportingGrades.png

**To export grades into a CSV file, follow the steps below:**

#. Navigate to the Grades & Performance section of the
   Gradebook.
#. Use the dropdown to filter by all, enrolled, or open learners.
#. In the upper right-hand corner, select the download button to the
   left of the gear button.

.. note:: The file will be saved to your computer (typically in your Downloads folder) with the name “[CourseID]\_[Open/ForCredit/Full”].”

The CSV file will include columns for learner username, ID number (if
available), as well as first and last name. The file will also contain
columns for each assignment and for the final grade (if applicable).
Learner grades will appear in the appropriate row and column. Excused
assignments will be indicated with the word “Excused.”
