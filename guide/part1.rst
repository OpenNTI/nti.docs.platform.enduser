PART I: Content, Gradebook, and Communication
=============================================

Featured Content                                
================================================

NextThought supports a variety of content types in order to customize
learning. All content is organized within a c ourse in your library. In
this section  we will learn about NextThought’s course organization and
the types of content supported.

                                        

Course Organization                                
---------------------------------------------------

A course is organized into five views :   Activity ,  Lessons ,
 Assignments , Discussions , and Course Info .

Access these views by first clicking on the course in your library.
Below are descriptions of each:         

#. .. rubric:: Activity   View
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.hfkxd3as8bsn

The Activity View organizes activity within the course into a stream and
invites students to engage in the course within the activity that is
most relevant to the course schedule. The stream displays activity in
order from most recent to oldest and includes assignments, readings,
active forum posts, as well as notes currently being discussed.

2. .. rubric:: Lessons View
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.7y4ud7kddf9r

The Lessons View contains all of the lessons or content for a course.
The Lessons View is divided into two section s: an interactive course
outline to the left modeled after the course syllabus, and the lesson
content to the right of the outline. Clicking on an individual lesson
within the outline will display all content inside of that lesson.
Typically one lesson will include brief lesson videos, a discussion,
readings, and perhaps a self-assessment or assignment.

If dates have been set for lessons, calendar dates will appear when
students or instructors hover their mouse over the lesson title in the
outline. This feature alerts the student as to when he or she is
expected to start interacting with the lesson’s material. You may also
make lessons available after a certain date to limit students’ access to
future material.

3. .. rubric:: Assignments Vage
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.aphlv880x4er

The Assignments View allows access to your Gradebook and student
assignment activity. It also enables you to view and download student
assignments and export grades.

The Assignments View is organized into three  tabs:   Assignments ,
Grades & Performance , and Activity & Notifications .

Gradebook Sections:                         

#. Assignments  Tab                                 

This section contains an interactive list of assignments within the
course. Selecting an assignment allows you to see all student
submissions for that specific assignment and assign grades, offer
feedback, and reset and excuse assignments.         

2. Grades & Performance Tab

Grades & Performance displays an interactive list of all students in
your course. Selecting a student will allow you to view that student’s
submissions and grades for the course as well as assign grades.
                        

3. Activity & Notifications Tab                                 

Activity & Notifications displays relevant updates about student
submissions and feedback by most recent to oldest.

 

.. note:: Please note: These three sections also appear for students; however,
their content differs from the instructor’s view.

4. .. rubric:: Discussions View
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.8gq2dby436rr

The DiscussionsView contains the discussion forums for the class. Here
the students can respond to your discussion prompts or create their own
discussions. You may also post course announcements here.

Organization:

There are three typical forums : “Discussions,” “Announcements,” and the
general “Forum.” “Discussions” will contain your course discussions
regarding the course material, and participation may be required.
“Announcements” is a place for the instructor to post announcements
throughout the duration of the course. The “Forum” is a place for
students to freely post about course topics.

Visibility:

Y our course forum may be split into sections by student enrollment
type, “Enrolled For-Credit” and “Open.” This allows you to have some
cours discussions viewable only to credit students.

5. .. rubric:: Course Info View                                        
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.b4tyrgn1haij

The Course Info View displays basic information about your course, such
as course dates, description, and instructor information. As an
instructor, your course roster and course summary report are also
accessible here. The course roster allows you to view a list of all
students in the course, email your students, and access student reports.

Types of Supported Content
--------------------------

Below is a list of the types of content NextThought supports as well as
descriptions of each. In a later section, we will discuss how this
material is organized. Please note that supported materials are always
being updated. If you do not see the type of material you want to

Reading Materials                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reading materials can be hosted on the platform or embedded on the
platform through another format such as a PDF. Notes can be created
beside all types of readings.         

Readings
^^^^^^^^

For hosted text, text (such as PDF or other formats) is first sent to
NextThought and our content development team makes it into a fully
interactive format to display on the learning platform. You can also
create your own fully interactive text to display on the platform too by
using our authoring tools. Please see “Create a Reading”  for more
information.

                                        

Features:

        

-  Highlight and add sharable notes to specific sections of the text.
-  Select and define words.
-  Add links, interactive footnotes, timelines, surveys and polls,
   assessment questions, videos, images, as well bibliographies
   throughout the reading.
-  Easily navigate multiple pages with paging tools.

                                                        

Embedded PDFs                                                        
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type of reading displays a static PDF inside of the platform.
Students can scroll through the PDF, read, download, and print it, and
can add notes to the side of the displayed PDF.                 

Videos                                         

Videos enhance learning by introducing course lessons, demonstrating
ideas, and engaging students.

                                        

Videos can appear in a lesson or they can be included inside of other
content such as readings, discussions, or assignments. NextThought can
assist you in creating professional videos to enhance your lessons, or
we can incorporate any prerecorded YouTube, Kaltura, or Vimeo video into
your course.

                                        

.. note::  Please contact NextThought if you are interested in using our Video
Team and Learning Designers to assist you in creating videos. Our Video
Team works both in-studio and on location.

 to learn more.                         

Transcripts
~~~~~~~~~~~

Video transcripts allow students to search for keywords, add
contextualized notes, and review the video’s transcript at their own
pace.

                                        

Every video can have an attached transcript, and NextThought assists
instructors in creating transcripts for videos. Transcripts appear
beside the video and offer many benefits for students. Transcripts allow
students to simultaneously watch the video and read the transcript. It
also allows students to add contextualized notes, search for keywords in
the video’s text, and jump to a specific place in the video by selecting
a section of the transcript’s text. Transcripts can also feature slides
to allow students to conveniently view the slides that correspond with
the ones in the video.

                                        

The transcript player has three views and also a gallery displaying all
videos in the course. To play the video in full screen, split video, or
split transcript view, select the drop-down arrow displayed in the upper
panel of the player. To preview all videos within the course within the
gallery, click the icon to the left of the transcript view drop-down.
                

Assignments and Self-Assessments                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test students’ comprehension of the material or give them an opportunity
to test themselves with assignments and self-assessments.

                                        

Assignments and self-assessments can be added to any lesson.
Self-assessment questions can also be included within a reading.
Assignments  are typically required and for a grade, and can only be
taken once. Self-assessments , however, allows students to test their
knowledge and may be taken multiple times.

Features:

-  Choose from several different questions types. To see a list of
   question types supported, visit “Assignment and Self-Assessment
   Question Types.”
-  Include downloadable documents, links, or embedded videos or images.
-  Display optional  tips, hints, and solutions for each question.
-  Set assignments to grade automatically upon submission (with the
   exception of essays, uploads, graded discussions,  and participation
   points, all which require manual grading).         
-  To learn about more options and features, please see the “Create an
   Assignment” within Part III  of the manual.

Discussion Forums                                         

Engage students and encourage participation and exploration of the
lesson through discussion prompts.

                                        

The course forum displays all course discussions and can be accessed
from

the Discussions View within the course. Discussions in the forum can
also be accessed directly through each lesson. This allows access to the
discussion from the Lesson View itself to contextualize the discussion
within a lesson’s readings, videos, and assessments. Discussions may
also be part of a graded assignment. We will discuss graded discussions
 later in the section titled \_\_\_\_\_\_ .

Visibility:

Your course forum may be split into sections by enrollment type:
“Enrolled For-Credit” and “Open.” Discussions and announcements within
the enrolled section can only be viewed by you and your enrolled,
for-credit students. Open discussions and announcements can be viewed by
the general public.

Instructor-led vs. Student-led Discussions

Typically only instructors can create new discussion threads in the open
and enrolled course discussions and announcements. Students, however,
are able to create and post new topics in the general course “Forum.”

        

External Links                                 

Create links for quick access to websites, research, videos, and other
content found outside the platform.

                                        

External links can be included in a lesson, reading, discussion, as well
as in an assignment or assessment. For example, an instructor may
require students to read an article written by a researcher whose work
exists on an external webpage.

Downloads                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provide documents for students to download, interact with, and/or print.

                                        

Downloadable documents may be included as a resource within a lesson or
can supplement other content types by adding them within assignments or
assessments, readings, and surveys and polls.                 

Surveys and Polls                                 

Create surveys and polls to collect feedback from students.

                                        

Surveys and polls gather feedback allowing instructors to assess
opinions or comprehension. Results, absent of student names, may be
displayed in graphs or charts. Surveys can be included in lessons, and
polls may be embedded within readings or other content.                 

Timelines                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allow students to visualize and interact with events on a timeline.

                                        

The Timeline feature allows students to visualize the order of events as
they learn about and interact with them. The Timeline includes a
scrollable timeline reel with events. Above the timeline, supplementary
images and text display, corresponding with the date and event selected.
                

Image and Video Reels                                         

Organize supplementary videos and images into a reel.

                                        

By collecting images and videos in one place within a reading, students
can easily and quickly scroll horizontally through a collection of
videos or images, clicking on them to play or enlarge.

                                

Assignment and Self-Assessment Question Types
---------------------------------------------

Listed below are the types of questions we support in assignments and
self-assessments. If you do not find a question type compatible with the
type of assessment you have, please contact us and we’d be happy to
assist you.

Question Types:

See below for descriptions of each. \* Starred items are only available
with assignments.

-  Multiple Choice
-  Multiple Answer
-  Ordering
-  Word Bank (Matching)
-  Mathematical Notation
-  Short Answer
-  Essay \*
-  File Upload\*
-  Discussion\*
-  FEATURE: Timed\*
-  FEATURE: Randomization \*
-  FEATURE: Question Bank\*
-  FEATURE: Gradebook Entry

Multiple Choice                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple choice question type allows students to select the best
possible answer out of a list of solutions.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when the answer to the question
asked is a single sentence or statement.         

Multiple Answer                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple answer question type allows students to select multiple
answers out of a list of solutions.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when the answer to the question
asked is potentially more than one sentence or statement.
                                        

Ordering                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ordering question type allows the student to arrange data and
information into the appropriate order.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when the solution requires a
specific ordering of information, such as the order of steps or events.
                        

Word Bank (Matching)                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The word bank allows students to use a bank of words to match with blank
spaces in statements or phrases below. A student selects an answer from
the bank and “drags” it to the appropriate space, “dropping” it into
place. The word bank can be customized to allow a single response to be
used once or multiple times.

                                                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when words or phrases can be left
out of a statement and collected into a bank of responses. It can also
be used to match a word or phrase with its description or definition.  
                

Mathematical Notation                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The math question type gives the student options to use mathematical
characters in the response field.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when the solution to the problem
includes mathematical notation.                                 

Short Answer                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The short answer question type provides a text field for students to
type a word or short phrase as their response.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use for questions that prompt the
student to display his or her breadth of understanding and knowledge in
writing. It allows for a single word or short phrase answer.

Essay                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The essay question type provides students with a text field to type
responses ranging from a few short sentences to several paragraphs.
Students are prompted by a question in the form of text, link, and/or
video. Responses are not limited on the platform by length.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use for questions that prompt the
student to display his or her breadth of understanding and knowledge in
writing. This type of response requires extra time to complete and more
extensive recall and organization of material .
                                

File Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~

The file upload question type allows students to submit files directly
to instructors for review. The NextThought platform will accept any
specified file type.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when a file by another program
outside of the NextThought platform is needed by the instructor for
review. The instructor can download student files.         

Discussion                                         
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As opposed to the essay assessment type where only the instructor and
student can see the student’s response, a discussion assignment prompts
students to respond within the course forums. This assessment type
displays the course discussion prompt from within the assignment itself
and includes a summary regarding the student’s activity at the bottom.
The student can respond by clicking the “Join the Discussion” button
within the assignment itself. The discussion can also be accessed from
the course Discussions View.

                                        

.. note::  This question type is best to use when participation within course
discussions are not only encouraged and expected, but required and
graded.                         

FEATURE: Randomization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most question types allow “randomization” for the questions and/or
solutions. Randomizing the questions would create a unique ordering of
the questions for each student. Randomizing the solutions would create a
unique ordering of solutions for each student.

FEATURE: Question Bank                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature allows a designated amount of questions from a larger set
of questions to be randomly selected and assigned to students. For
example, five different questions can be randomly assigned to a student
from a bank of ten questions. The student would only see and respond to
those five questions.

                                        

                        

FEATURE: Timed Assessments                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature restricts the student to a designated amount of time to
complete the assignment. When the student selects the assignment to
begin, a window will prompt the student to acknowledge that the
assignment is timed and that, once started, the timer will not stop.
Once acknowledged, the assignment will be viewable and the timer will
begin. The timer, displaying the amount of time left, is constantly
displayed while the student works through his or her assignment. When
the student submits the assignment for grading, the submitted assignment
will indicate to both the instructor and student if the student
submitted within the allotted time.                 

FEATURE: Gradebook Entry                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A gradebook entry allows the instructor to add a grade when one is
needed for an activity that occurs outside the platform. It can also be
used when graded activities within the platform do not require an
explicit and immediate question-response action. For example, if a
service activity or interview is required, a gradebook entry allows you
to assign a grade and offer feedback once the activity is completed.
This question type can include text, video, images, links, or downloads
to explain the graded activity, but does not require any action on the
assignment within the platform itself.

                                        

                                        

Gradebook                                 
==========================================

The NextThought Gradebook allows you to assign and export grades, view
and download assignments, keep track of student activity, contact
students, and more . The G radebook is located within your course under
the Assignments View and contains three sections:  “Assignments,”
“Grades & Performance,” and “Activity & Notifications.”

gear icon located in the upper right-hand corner.
                        

3. .. rubric:: Activity & Notifications                                
      :name: NextThoughtInstructorsGuide.xhtml#h.fxsvdfcemkpl

The Activity & Notification section is the go-to place to see all
important updates and notices relating to assignments.

Assignment notifications are organized by date, with the most recent
activities near the top of the stream. Clicking on a notification will
navigate you to that activity.

Instructor Notifications Include:

-  Student submission
-  Student feedback
-  Instructor feedback

--------------

Student Notifications Include:

-  New assignment
-  Overdue assignment
-  Assignment submission
-  Student feedback
-  Instructor feedback
-  New grades
-  Posted final grade

                                        

.. warning:: Please note: Due to the large amount of activity generated in
instructor accounts, student submission notifications will only appear
in the Activity & Notifications section of the Gradebook and will not
appear in your general notifications located within the bell icon in the
upper right-hand corner of your account. Students, however, will
continue to receive important notifications such as feedback or an
assigned grade in both streams. To learn more about the general
notification stream, please visit the guide’s “Notifications” section on
page (21).

Grading Assignments                                        
-----------------------------------------------------------

Instructors may add or modify a grade, reset and excuse assignments, and
leave feedback.

Adding a Grade                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grades can be added within the Student View  or Assignment View .

                                        

Grades can be added within the student view or assignment view. Once you
have added a grade by typing in a numerical or alphabetical value, the
grade will automatically save.

Grades can be manually or automatically assigned. If an assignment has
concrete answers (as opposed to essay questions), NextThought can enable
automatic grading. This feature would assign an automatic and viewable
grade upon completion of the assignment.

                                        

.. note::  Please note: An instructor can modify an automatic or manual grade at
any time by clicking on the grade and typing in a new value.

will be notified in the “Activity & Notifications” section of your
Gradebook. To navigate to the feedback, click on the activity
notification.
                                                                 

Grade Predictor
---------------

The grade predictor displays for both students and teachers and allows
the student to estimate his or her end of the year course grade. Please
let NextThought know if you are interested in making this feature
available.

The grade predictor predicts the course grade of the student based on
the total points available and the total points earned by the student.
In other words, the grade predictor takes the student’s currently earned
points and divides by the currently available total points of
assignments. This creates a percent between 0% and 100%.

Location:

-  For the student,  the grade predictor will be available in the
   student’s “Grade & Performance” tab under “Course Grade.”
-  For the instructor,  click on the “Grades & Performance” tab.
   Students will have a “Projected Grade” column.

.. note:: For additional specifications regarding the grade predictor, please
contact NextThought.

Final Grades                                
--------------------------------------------

Within the Gradebook, instructors can add final course grades. If you
are interested in this feature, please contact NextThought.

                                        

Assign a final grade by navigating to the Grades & Performance section
of the Gradebook. Add a number grade or a letter grade for each student
under the column titled “Grade.” Alternatively, add a final grade by
selecting a student’s name. This opens a list of the student’s course
assignments and individual grades. Enter the final grade at the top
right-hand corner under “Course Grade.” The student will receive a
notification and will be able to view his or her final grade.         

                                        

Downloading Student Files
