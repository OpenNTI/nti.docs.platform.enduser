PART I: Content, Gradebook, and Communication
=============================================


Course Organization
================================================

NextThought supports a variety of content types in order to customize
learning. All content is organized within a course in your library.  

A course is organized into five views: Activity, Lessons,
Assignments, Discussions, and Course Info.

   .. image:: images/courseOrganization.png

Access these views by first clicking on the course in your library.
Below are descriptions of each.

Activity View
---------------------------------------------------

The Activity View organizes activity within the course into a stream and
invites students to engage in the course within the activity that is
most relevant to the course schedule. The stream displays activity in
order from most recent to oldest and includes assignments, readings,
active forum posts, as well as notes currently being discussed.

   .. image:: images/activityView.png

Lessons View
---------------------------------------------------

The Lessons View contains all of the lessons or content for a course.
The Lessons View is divided into two sections: an interactive course
outline to the left modeled after the course syllabus, and the lesson
content to the right of the outline. Clicking on an individual lesson
within the outline will display all content inside of that lesson.
Typically one lesson will include brief lesson videos, a discussion,
readings, and perhaps a self-assessment or assignment.

If dates have been set for lessons, calendar dates will appear when
students or instructors hover their mouse over the lesson title in the
outline. This feature alerts the student as to when he or she is
expected to start interacting with the lesson’s material. You may also
make lessons available after a certain date to limit students’ access to
future material.

	.. image:: images/lessonsView.png

Assignments View
---------------------------------------------------

The Assignments View allows access to your Gradebook and student
assignment activity. It also enables you to view and download student
assignments and export grades.

The Assignments View is organized into three tabs: Assignments,
Grades & Performance, and Activity & Notifications.

Assignments Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains an interactive list of assignments within the
course. Selecting an assignment allows you to see all student
submissions for that specific assignment and assign grades, offer
feedback, and reset and excuse assignments.         

    .. image:: images/assignmentsTab.png

Grades & Performance Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grades & Performance displays an interactive list of all students in
your course. Selecting a student will allow you to view that student’s
submissions and grades for the course as well as assign grades.
                        

    .. image:: images/gradesPerformanceTab.png

Activity & Notifications Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Activity & Notifications displays relevant updates about student
submissions and feedback by most recent to oldest.

.. image:: images/activityNotificationsTab.png

.. note:: Please note: These three sections also appear for students; however, their content differs from the instructor’s view.

Discussions View
---------------------------------------------------

The Discussions View contains the discussion forums for the class. Here
the students can respond to your discussion prompts or create their own
discussions. You may also post course announcements here.

    .. image:: images/discussionsView.png

Organization:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three typical forums: “Discussions,” “Announcements,” and the
general “Forum.” “Discussions” will contain your course discussions
regarding the course material, and participation may be required.
“Announcements” is a place for the instructor to post announcements
throughout the duration of the course. The “Forum” is a place for
students to freely post about course topics.

Visibility:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your course forum may be split into sections by student enrollment
type, “Enrolled For-Credit” and “Open.” This allows you to have some
cours discussions viewable only to credit students.

Course Info View
---------------------------------------------------

The Course Info View displays basic information about your course, such
as course dates, description, and instructor information. As an
instructor, your course roster and course summary report are also
accessible here. The course roster allows you to view a list of all
students in the course, email your students, and access student reports.

   .. image:: images/courseInfoView.png

Reading Materials                                
---------------------------------------------------

Reading materials can be hosted on the platform or embedded on the
platform through another format such as a PDF. Notes can be created
beside all types of readings.

Readings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For hosted text, text (such as PDF or other formats) is first sent to
NextThought and our content development team makes it into a fully
interactive format to display on the learning platform. 

You can also create your own fully interactive text to display on the platform by
using our authoring tools. Please see “Create a Reading” for more
information.

**Features:**

.. image:: images/readings.png

-  Highlight and add sharable notes to specific sections of the text.
-  Select and define words.

.. image:: images/readings2.png
-  Add links, interactive footnotes, timelines, surveys and polls,
   assessment questions, videos, images, as well bibliographies
   throughout the reading.
-  Easily navigate multiple pages with paging tools.


Embedded PDFs                                                        
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/embeddedPDFs.png

This type of reading displays a static PDF inside of the platform.
Students can scroll through the PDF, read, download, and print it, and
can add notes to the side of the displayed PDF.

Videos                                         
---------------------------------------------------

Videos enhance learning by introducing course lessons, demonstrating
ideas, and engaging students.

.. image:: images/videos.png

Videos can appear in a lesson or they can be included inside of other
content such as readings, discussions, or assignments. NextThought can
assist you in creating professional videos to enhance your lessons, or
we can incorporate any prerecorded YouTube, Kaltura, or Vimeo video into
your course.

.. note::  Please contact NextThought if you are interested in using our Video Team and Learning Designers to assist you in creating videos. Our Video Team works both in-studio and on location. Visit https://nextthought.com/video-services to learn more.

Transcripts
---------------------------------------------------

Video transcripts allow students to search for keywords, add
contextualized notes, and review the video’s transcript at their own
pace.

Every video can have an attached transcript, and NextThought assists
instructors in creating transcripts for videos. Transcripts appear
beside the video and offer many benefits for students. Transcripts allow
students to simultaneously watch the video and read the transcript. It
also allows students to add contextualized notes, search for keywords in
the video’s text, and jump to a specific place in the video by selecting
a section of the transcript’s text. Transcripts can also feature slides
to allow students to conveniently view the slides that correspond with
the ones in the video.

.. image:: images/transcripts1.png

---------------------------------------------------

Test students’ comprehension of the material or give them an opportunity
to test themselves with assignments and self-assessments.

Assignments and self-assessments can be added to any lesson.
Self-assessments can also be included within a reading. Each assignment 
or self-assessment can include downloadable documents, links, and
embedded videos and images. Each question can also include tips and hints 
for that question, as well as display the solution once the assignment has 
been submitted. Displaying tips, hints, and solutions are optional.

.. image:: images/assignmentsAndSelfAssessments.png

.. note::  Best to use when the solution requires a specific ordering of information, such as the order of steps or events.

Word Bank (Matching)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/wordBankMatching.png

Allows students to use a word bank to match with blank spaces in statements or phrases below. The word bank can be customized to allow a response to be used multiple times.

.. note::  Best to use when answers can be left out of a statement and collected into a bank. It can also be used to match terms with definitions.

Mathematical Notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/mathematicalNotation.png

Offers students the use of mathematical characters in the response field.

.. note::  Best to use when the solution to the problem includes mathematical notation.

Short Answer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/shortAnswer.png

Provides a text field for students to type a word or short phrase as their response.

.. note::  Best to use for questions that prompt the student to display his or her breadth of understanding and knowledge in writing. It allows for a single word or short phrase answer.

Essay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/essay.png

Provides students with a text field to respond to questions in short sentences or several paragraphs. Responses are not limited in length.

.. note::  Best to use when participation within course discussions are not only encouraged and expected, but required and graded.

.. image:: images/quiz.png

FEATURE: Randomization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/randomization.png

Most question types allow “randomization” for the questions and/or
solutions. Randomizing the questions would create a unique ordering of
the questions for each student. Randomizing the solutions would create a
unique ordering of solutions for each student.

FEATURE: Question Bank
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/questionBank.png

Allows a designated amount of questions from a larger set of questions to be randomly selected and assigned to students. For example, five different questions can be randomly assigned to a student from a bank of ten questions. The student would only see and respond to those five questions.

FEATURE: Timed Assessments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/timedAssessments.png

Restricts the student to a designated amount of time to complete the assignment. A window will prompt the student to acknowledge that the assignment is timed. The submitted assignment will indicate to both the instructor and student if the student submitted within the allotted time.

FEATURE: Gradebook Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/gradebookEntry.png

Allows the instructor to add a grade when one is needed for an activity that occurs outside the platform, or on another part of the platform. It does not require a submission within the assignment itself, but only acts as a grade entry.

Discussion Forums
---------------------------------------------------

Engage students and encourage participation and exploration of the
lesson through discussion prompts.

The course forum displays all course discussions and can be accessed from the Discussions View. Individual discussions in the forum can also be accessed directly through each lesson. This allows access to the discussion from the Lesson View itself to contextualize the discussion within readings, videos, and assessments. Discussions may also be part of a graded assignment.

**Visibility:**

Your course forum may be split into sections by enrollment type:
“Enrolled For-Credit” and “Open.” Discussions and announcements within
the enrolled section can only be viewed by you and your enrolled,
for-credit students. Open discussions and announcements can be viewed by
the general public.

**Instructor-led vs. Student-led Discussions**

Typically only instructors can create new discussion threads in the open
and enrolled course discussions and announcements. Students, however,
are able to create and post new topics in the general course “Forum.”

External Links
---------------------------------------------------

Create links for quick access to websites, research, videos, and other
content found outside the platform.

External links can be included in a lesson, reading, discussion, as well
as in an assignment or assessment. For example, an instructor may
require students to read an article written by a researcher whose work
exists on an external webpage.

Downloads
---------------------------------------------------

Provide documents for students to download, interact with, and/or print.

Downloadable documents may be included as a resource within a lesson or
can supplement other content types by adding them within assignments or
assessments, readings, and surveys and polls.

Surveys and Polls
---------------------------------------------------

Create surveys and polls to collect feedback from students.

Surveys and polls gather feedback allowing instructors to assess
opinions or comprehension. Results, absent of student names, may be
displayed in graphs or charts. Surveys can be included in lessons, and
polls may be embedded within readings or other content.

Timelines
---------------------------------------------------

Allow students to visualize and interact with events on a timeline.

The Timeline feature allows students to visualize the order of events as
they learn about and interact with them. The Timeline includes a
scrollable timeline reel with events. Above the timeline, supplementary
images and text display, corresponding with the date and event selected.

Image and Video Reels
---------------------------------------------------

Organize supplementary videos and images into a reel.

By collecting images and videos in one place within a reading, students
can easily and quickly scroll horizontally through a collection of
videos or images, clicking on them to play or enlarge.

Grade Predictor
--------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: images/gradePredictor.png

The grade predictor displays for both students and teachers and allows
the student to estimate his or her end of the year course grade. Please
let NextThought know if you are interested in making this feature
available.

The grade predictor predicts the course grade of the student based on
the total points available and the total points earned by the student.
In other words, the grade predictor takes the student’s currently earned
points and divides by the currently available total points of
assignments. This creates a percent between 0% and 100%.

**Location:**

-  For the student, the grade predictor will be available in the
   student’s “Grade & Performance” tab under “Course Grade.”
-  For the instructor, click on the “Grades & Performance” tab.
   Students will have a “Projected Grade” column.

.. note:: For additional specifications regarding the grade predictor, please contact NextThought.

Final Grades
--------------------------------------------

Within the Gradebook, instructors can add final course grades. If you
are interested in this feature, please contact NextThought.

Assign a final grade by navigating to the Grades & Performance section
of the Gradebook. Add a number grade or a letter grade for each student
under the column titled “Grade.” Alternatively, add a final grade by
selecting a student’s name. This opens a list of the student’s course
assignments and individual grades. Enter the final grade at the top
right-hand corner under “Course Grade.” The student will receive a
notification and will be able to view his or her final grade. 

Downloading Student Files
---------------------------------------------------------

hub for its members. This page’s activity stream will display all notes
shared with the group across readings and other materials, and also

any topic such as group meeting times, projects, and more.
