Course Progress and Completion

**Progress** is defined by a learner completing required materials. In order for a learner to complete required materials, materials must be viewed (video, PDF, readings, etc.) or submitted (survey, self-assessment, assignments). Materials can be marked as "Required" when in Edit Mode. Learners will see the "Required" label on each required content.

- and the average class completion (all learner completion percentages added and divided by the number of learners).
