NextThought Instructor's Guide
==============================

Welcome to NextThought! We’re excited that you’ve chosen to partner with
us in building the future of online learning.

Our platform offers a multitude of features to manage, facilitate,
create, and customize your learning environment. We’re unlike any
learning platform you’ve experienced before, so we want to be sure and
cover all of your questions. In this guide, we want to walk you through
our platform: from helping you understand the types of content we
support to building an entire course! Of course, you may not need all
the explanation provided, so feel free to skip around in this guide to
find what you’re looking for.

In this guide we’ve included descriptions of supported materials, course
organization, course communication features, how to use the Gradebook,
as well as step-by-step procedures in creating a course from start to
finish.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Typically you will have been assigned to a Project Manager to take care
of any questions or concerns. If you do not know who to contact, you can
always contact us at support@nextthought.com.

Enjoy your course!
