In this guide, we want to walk you through
our platform: from helping you understand the types of content we
support to building an entire course! Of course, you may not need all
the explanation provided, so feel free to skip around in this guide to
find what you’re looking for.

In this guide we’ve included descriptions of supported materials, course
organization, course communication features, how to use the Gradebook,
as well as step-by-step procedures in creating a course from start to
finish.
