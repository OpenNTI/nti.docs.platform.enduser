Reading Materials                                
---------------------------------------------------

Reading materials can be hosted on the platform or embedded on the
platform through another format such as a PDF. Notes can be created
beside all types of readings.

Readings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For hosted text, text (such as PDF or other formats) is first sent to
NextThought and our content development team makes it into a fully
interactive format to display on the learning platform. 

You can also create your own fully interactive text to display on the platform by
using our authoring tools. Please see “Create a Reading” for more
information.

**Features:**

.. image:: images/readings.png

-  Highlight and add sharable notes to specific sections of the text.
-  Select and define words.

.. image:: images/readings2.png
-  Add links, interactive footnotes, timelines, surveys and polls,
   assessment questions, videos, images, as well bibliographies
   throughout the reading.
-  Easily navigate multiple pages with paging tools.


Embedded PDFs                                                        
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/embeddedPDFs.png

This type of reading displays a static PDF inside of the platform.
Students can scroll through the PDF, read, download, and print it, and
can add notes to the side of the displayed PDF.

Videos                                         
---------------------------------------------------

Videos enhance learning by introducing course lessons, demonstrating
ideas, and engaging students.

.. image:: images/videos.png

Videos can appear in a lesson or they can be included inside of other
content such as readings, discussions, or assignments. NextThought can
assist you in creating professional videos to enhance your lessons, or
we can incorporate any prerecorded YouTube, Kaltura, or Vimeo video into
your course.

.. note::  Please contact NextThought if you are interested in using our Video Team and Learning Designers to assist you in creating videos. Our Video Team works both in-studio and on location. Visit https://nextthought.com/video-services to learn more.

Transcripts
---------------------------------------------------

Video transcripts allow students to search for keywords, add
contextualized notes, and review the video’s transcript at their own
pace.

Every video can have an attached transcript, and NextThought assists
instructors in creating transcripts for videos. Transcripts appear
beside the video and offer many benefits for students. Transcripts allow
students to simultaneously watch the video and read the transcript. It
also allows students to add contextualized notes, search for keywords in
the video’s text, and jump to a specific place in the video by selecting
a section of the transcript’s text. Transcripts can also feature slides
to allow students to conveniently view the slides that correspond with
the ones in the video.

The transcript player has three views and also a gallery displaying all 
videos in the course. To play the video in full screen, split video, or
split transcript view, select the dropdown arrow displayed in the upper
panel of the player. To preview all videos within the course within the
gallery, click the icon to the left of the transcript view dropdown.

Assignments and Self-Assessments                        
---------------------------------------------------

Test students’ comprehension of the material or give them an opportunity
to test themselves with assignments and self-assessments.

Assignments and self-assessments can be added to any lesson.
Self-assessments can also be included within a reading. Each assignment 
or self-assessment can include downloadable documents, links, and
embedded videos and images. Each question can also include tips and hints 
for that question, as well as display the solution once the assignment has 
been submitted. Displaying tips, hints, and solutions are optional.

.. image:: images/quiz.png

FEATURE: Randomization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/randomization.png

Most question types allow “randomization” for the questions and/or
solutions. Randomizing the questions would create a unique ordering of
the questions for each student. Randomizing the solutions would create a
unique ordering of solutions for each student.

FEATURE: Question Bank
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/questionBank.png

Allows a designated amount of questions from a larger set of questions to be randomly selected and assigned to students. For example, five different questions can be randomly assigned to a student from a bank of ten questions. The student would only see and respond to those five questions.

FEATURE: Timed Assessments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/timedAssessments.png

Restricts the student to a designated amount of time to complete the assignment. A window will prompt the student to acknowledge that the assignment is timed. The submitted assignment will indicate to both the instructor and student if the student submitted within the allotted time.

FEATURE: Gradebook Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/gradebookEntry.png

Allows the instructor to add a grade when one is needed for an activity that occurs outside the platform, or on another part of the platform. It does not require a submission within the assignment itself, but only acts as a grade entry.

Discussion Forums
---------------------------------------------------

Engage students and encourage participation and exploration of the
lesson through discussion prompts.

The course forum displays all course discussions and can be accessed from the Discussions View. Individual discussions in the forum can also be accessed directly through each lesson. This allows access to the discussion from the Lesson View itself to contextualize the discussion within readings, videos, and assessments. Discussions may also be part of a graded assignment.

**Visibility:**

Your course forum may be split into sections by enrollment type:
“Enrolled For-Credit” and “Open.” Discussions and announcements within
the enrolled section can only be viewed by you and your enrolled,
for-credit students. Open discussions and announcements can be viewed by
the general public.

**Instructor-led vs. Student-led Discussions**

Typically only instructors can create new discussion threads in the open
and enrolled course discussions and announcements. Students, however,
are able to create and post new topics in the general course “Forum.”

External Links
---------------------------------------------------

Create links for quick access to websites, research, videos, and other
content found outside the platform.

External links can be included in a lesson, reading, discussion, as well
as in an assignment or assessment. For example, an instructor may
require students to read an article written by a researcher whose work
exists on an external webpage.

Downloads
---------------------------------------------------

Provide documents for students to download, interact with, and/or print.

Downloadable documents may be included as a resource within a lesson or
can supplement other content types by adding them within assignments or
assessments, readings, and surveys and polls.

Surveys and Polls
---------------------------------------------------

Create surveys and polls to collect feedback from students.

Surveys and polls gather feedback allowing instructors to assess
opinions or comprehension. Results, absent of student names, may be
displayed in graphs or charts. Surveys can be included in lessons, and
polls may be embedded within readings or other content.

Timelines
---------------------------------------------------

Allow students to visualize and interact with events on a timeline.

The Timeline feature allows students to visualize the order of events as
they learn about and interact with them. The Timeline includes a
scrollable timeline reel with events. Above the timeline, supplementary
images and text display, corresponding with the date and event selected.

Image and Video Reels
---------------------------------------------------

Organize supplementary videos and images into a reel.

By collecting images and videos in one place within a reading, students
can easily and quickly scroll horizontally through a collection of
videos or images, clicking on them to play or enlarge.
