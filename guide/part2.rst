===========================
PART II: Create Your Course
===========================

The NextThought application allows instructors to build their own course
with our authoring tools. The authoring tools allow you a wide-range of
functionality including building the course outline (lessons, units,
sections), adding course materials (readings, videos, discussions),
creating assignments, creating readings, and more.

Getting Started: Content Organization
=======================================

All NextThought courses have an organizational layout that
includes units, lessons, and sections.

Let’s start by reviewing the course organization within the Lessons
View, the view that holds all of the content for the course.

.. image:: images/authoringorganization.png

-  *Unit:* A “unit” simply acts as a header for several lessons. Each unit
   contains one or more lessons. Units can be further organized into
   lessons.
-  *Lesson:* A “lesson” is the main content module for the course. When a
   student enters a course from the homepage, they will be viewing the
   first course lesson. Lessons can be further organized into sections.
-  *Section:*  A “section” is the lowest level organization for course
   materials. Sections divide and organize materials within the lesson
   with a section header.

When you log into your course, it opens into the Lessons View. By
default you will be in the the View Only mode when you open the course.
The View mode reflects what students see when they log into the course.
To modify course content, click on the “Start Editing” button in the
lower right-hand corner to switch to Edit Mode.

.. note:: The Start Editing button is only available on the Lessons View.

Course Units
=============================

Lessons are organized into units.

Each course must have at least one unit. You may want to organize your
course units by weeks, by topics, or by content types. How you structure
your course is up to you.

Adding a Unit
-------------

The first step toward creating your course is adding units.

 
1. On the Lessons View, click on the “ Start Editing”  button in the
   bottom right-hand corner to switch from View Mode to Edit Mode.
  
2. Click the  “+Add Unit” at the bottom of the course outline.

3. Type in a title  for the unit.

4. Hit the return  key to create the unit.

.. note::  You may add a new unit at any time by clicking on the “+Add Unit” button at the bottom of the course outline.

.. note::  If you have existing content in your course, you will see all of your existing units and lessons in the course outline, including
published, draft, and scheduled lessons while in Edit Mode.

Editing a Unit
--------------------

NextThought tools allow you to edit, move, and delete units as needed
after creation.

First, open the Edit Unit Flyout:

#. Select the unit you want to edit by clicking on the unit title in
   the course outline. This will open the unit page in editing mode.
#. Now, select the “Edit” button. This opens the Edit Unit Flyout.

Course Lessons
================

Once you have created a unit, you can add lessons.

Lessons hold your course content and are the main content delivery
module for all courses. A lesson must be contained within a unit, and
you may have multiple lessons within a unit. Your course must have at
least one unit and one Lesson.

#. If you are in View Mode, click on the Start Editing button in the
   bottom right-hand corner to switch to Edit Mode. 
#. Select the unit you want to add a lesson to by clicking on the unit
   title in the course outline. 
#. Click on “+Add Lesson” at the bottom of the unit in the outline.
#. Type in a title for the lesson. |AddLesson.png|
#. Hit the “return” key to create the lesson.

Editing a Lesson
-------------------

NextThought tools allow you to edit, move, and delete lessons as needed
after creation through the Edit Lesson Flyout. Within the lesson
itself, you can change the availability, or “publish state,” of the
lesson (publish now, schedule, draft) and add a lesson time frame.

To open the Edit Lesson Flyout:

#. Select the lesson you want to edit by clicking on the lesson title
   in the course outline.
#. Click the “Edit” button. This opens the Edit Lesson Flyout.

 |LessonEditBox.png|

After you have made changes, click “Save” to implement your changes.
Or, cancel the edits  by clicking on “Cancel” button or clicking on
the “X” in the upper right-hand corner of the flyout.

Setting the Lesson Availability
---------------------------------

The Publish State Flyout  controls when students are able to view the
lesson and includes three states: Publish Now, Schedule, and Draft.  

 |LessonAvailability.png|

-  **Draft:** Keep lesson visible ONLY to instructors in Edit Mode.

.. note::  A draft lesson is not visible to students and is only visible to the instructor when in Edit Mode. When a lesson is created, it automatically defaults to “Draft” until the instructor changes its status.

-  **Publish Now:** Immediately make lesson fully visible to students.
   |Schedule\_Outline.png|

.. note::  A published lesson is visible to anyone who is in the course, and appears in the course outline.

-  **Schedule:** Schedule lesson to be fully visible to students on a
   certain date and time. |SchedulingLessons.png|

.. note::  A scheduled lesson is is only fully visible on and after the designated start date and time. The lesson title will appear as lighter grey text until the start date has passed. Students will see this text, but will not be able to view the lesson. Instructors will only be able to click on and view a scheduled lesson when in Edit Mode.

Lessons can be changed between these three different states at any time.

To Publish Now or send the lesson back to Draft, simply select the
desired status in the Publish State Flyout. To schedule a lesson, follow
the instructions below:

#. Select “Schedule” in the Publish State Flyout.
#. Select the date and enter a time.

dropdown under the assignment name.

.. warning:: Deleting the assignment is a non-recoverable action.

.. note::  To learn more about the assignment editing view, see Part III regarding assignment authoring.

Publish States
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are four options within the Assignment date dropdown and flyouts,
including three publish states and a due date option:

 |image71| |image72|

#. **Publish (publish state)**

Selecting this option allows you to publish the assignment immediately.
In other words, students will be able to begin taking the assignment as
soon as the assignment is published.

2. **Schedule (publish state)**

Scheduling the assignment allows you to choose the date and time that
the assignment becomes available for students to view and take. Before
this date, the assignment title can be seen within the lessons and
assignments view, but the student will not be able to click into it to
view questions.

3. **Draft (publish state)**

If not already selected, this option sends the assignment back into
draft mode. This allows the instructor to continue editing the
assignment. While an assignment is in this state, students will not be
able to see the assignment.

.. warning:: This state is only available for authored assignments. Learn more in Part III Create an Assignment.

4. **Due Date (due date)**

Choose the month, date, year and time that the assignment is due.
Assignments are still available once the due date passes, but will be
marked as late in the gradebook if completed after the date has passed.

.. warning:: If an assignment has already been taken by a student, you will have to “Reset Assignment” to access the publish states and change them.
