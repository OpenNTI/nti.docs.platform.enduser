Connect on the Community Page
================================================

.. image:: images/CommunityPage.png

Our community feature offers a collaborative meeting space for individuals to interact outside of a course context. The community page offers members a space to post a topic or question for the community to respond to, and also offers a list of community members for easy networking and communication. 

To locate your community page, navigate to your homepage and click on a community.

Organize Groups
================================================

Create a meeting space to share best practices with a group of instructors, or set up student groups for class projects.

The group feature allows for a collection of individuals to privately and quickly share notes, ideas, and discussions between one another. Both instructors and students can create groups. Creating a group also sets up a Group page. A Group page is the meeting hub for its members. This page’s activity stream will display all notes shared with the group across readings and other materials, and also allows members to post a discussion directly to the group page regarding any topic.

.. image:: images/Groups.png

**To create a group and visit the group page:**

#. Navigate to your Contacts page, and click on the tab labeled
   “Groups.”
#. At the bottom of the left-hand panel, click on “Create Group.”
#. Type a group name.
#. Select “Create” to create the group. Once the group is created, you will see a group code. Be sure to
   keep this group code to send to your contacts.
#. Click on the created group within your Contacts page to navigate to
   the Group page.

Share your code with your contacts to build group membership. If you’ve forgotten your code, click on the dropdown arrow next to the group name on your Contacts page and click “Group Code" to view and copy it. Your contacts can select “Join Group” on their Contacts page and enter the group code to become a group member.

Now that you’ve created a group, you can share notes privately with group members by creating a note and adding the group name to the sharing field. See “Create a Note" to learn more.
