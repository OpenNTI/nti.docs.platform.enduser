External Links

Add a URL/External Link
-----------------------------

Adding an external link to your course places that site within the
context of your lesson, and allows students to quickly navigate to an
external page. You can link to any valid URL from within your lessons.
Links open in a new tab within your browsing window.

#. While in Edit Mode, click on “+Add Content” in the section you want to edit.
