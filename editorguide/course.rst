===========================
Create Your Course Outline
===========================

The NextThought application allows instructors to build their own course
with our authoring tools. The authoring tools allow you a wide range of
functionality including building the course outline (lessons, units,
sections), adding course materials (readings, videos, discussions, links, files),
creating assignments, creating readings, and more.


Getting Started: Content Organization
=======================================

All NextThought courses have an organizational layout that
includes units, lessons, and sections.

.. image:: images/authoringorganization.png

-  **Unit:** A “unit” simply acts as a header for several lessons. Each unit
   contains one or more lessons. Units can be further organized into
   lessons.
-  **Lesson:** A “lesson” is the main content module for the course. When a
   learner enters a course from the homepage, they will be viewing the
   first course lesson. Lessons can be further organized into sections.
-  **Section:**  A “section” is the lowest level organization for course
   materials. Sections divide and organize materials within the lesson
   with a section header.
   
   
**Course Default View**

When you enter your course from the homepage, it opens into the Lessons View. You will be viewing the course as if you were a learner.

To modify course content, click on the “Start Editing” button in the lower right-hand corner to switch to Edit Mode.
