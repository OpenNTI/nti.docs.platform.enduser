===========================
Create Your Course Outline
===========================

The NextThought application allows instructors to build their own course
with our authoring tools. The authoring tools allow you a wide range of
functionality including building the course outline (lessons, units,
sections), adding course materials (readings, videos, discussions, links, files),
creating assignments, creating readings, and more.


Getting Started: Content Organization
=======================================

All NextThought courses have an organizational layout that
includes units, lessons, and sections.

.. image:: images/authoringorganization.png

-  **Unit:** A “unit” simply acts as a header for several lessons. Each unit
   contains one or more lessons. Units can be further organized into
   lessons.
-  **Lesson:** A “lesson” is the main content module for the course. When a
   learner enters a course from the homepage, they will be viewing the
   first course lesson. Lessons can be further organized into sections.
-  **Section:**  A “section” is the lowest level organization for course
   materials. Sections divide and organize materials within the lesson
   with a section header.
   
   
**Course Default View**

When you enter your course from the homepage, it opens into the Lessons View. You will be viewing the course as if you were a learner.

To modify course content, click on the “Start Editing” button in the lower right-hand corner to switch to Edit Mode.

.. image:: images/starteditingbutton.png

.. note:: The Start Editing button is only available on the Lessons View. 


Course Units
=============================

Lessons are organized into units.

course units by weeks, by topics, or by content types. How you structure
your course is up to you.

Course Lessons
================

Once you have created a unit, you can add lessons.

module for all courses. A lesson must be contained within a unit, and
you may have multiple lessons within a unit. Your course must have at

After you have made changes, click “Save” to implement your changes.


Set the Lesson Availability
---------------------------------

The **Publish State Flyout** controls when students are able to view the
lesson and includes three states: Publish Now, Schedule, and Draft.  

.. image:: images/publishstatelesson.png

- **Draft:** Lesson is visible ONLY to instructors/editors/admin and only in Edit Mode. When a lesson is created, it automatically defaults to “Draft” until the instructor changes its status.
- **Publish Now:** Immediately make lesson fully visible to students.
- **Schedule:** Schedule lesson to be fully visible to students on a certain date and time. The lesson title will appear as lighter grey text until the start date has passed. Students will see this text, but will not be able to view the lesson. Instructors will only be able to click on and view a scheduled lesson when in Edit Mode.

.. note:: Lessons can be changed between these three different states at any time.

To Publish Now or send the lesson back to Draft, simply select the
desired status in the Publish State Flyout. And click "Save."

or pointer hovers over a particular lesson in the course outline, or
when a lesson is selected. The start and end date is also displayed over the lesson title on the specific lesson’s page.
