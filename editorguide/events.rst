Events
======================

Use Events to inform learners of upcoming in-person or online events. Events are tied to a NextThought course and display both within a Lesson and within the user's NextThought calendar. Learners can use the Calendar feature to sync events with their personal calendar app such as Google Calendar or iCal so they can always stay up-to-date with your Course's important happenings.
