Add a File from your Computer
---------------------------------

File uploads are content files that you upload from your computer into
lessons within your course. You can upload most any file, including:

-  Microsoft Office files (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.)
-  PDFs
-  Images (.jpg, .gif, .png)
-  Zip files
-  And others such as .xml, .odt, .rtf, .epub, .mp4, .txt

.. note:: Please note: Only PDFs will display within the application itself. Students can read PDF files within the course and add comments and notes. All other file types will have to be downloaded by students for off-platform viewing. Students will need the appropriate software to open the file.

In order to add content to a section from your computer, follow the
steps below:

#. While in Edit Mode, click on “+Add Content” in the section you want to edit.

   .. warning:: Please note: if you don’t see “+Add Content” you need to first add a section to the lesson page (see the above section on Adding sections to lessons).
