Computer Files
======================

File uploads are content files that you upload from your computer into
lessons within your course. You can upload most any file, including:

-  Microsoft Office files (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.)
-  PDFs
-  Images (.jpg, .gif, .png)
-  Zip files
-  And others such as .xml, .odt, .rtf, .epub, .mp4, .txt

.. note:: Please note, only PDFs will display within the application itself. Learners can read PDF files within the course and add comments and notes. All other file types will have to be downloaded by learners for off-platform viewing. Learners will need the appropriate software to open the file.
