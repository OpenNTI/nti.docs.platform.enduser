============================
Add and Edit Course Content
============================

Add a variety of content types to make your course more dynamic.

Below is different types of content you can add to your lesson:

-  Readings
-  PDFs, Slides, and Other Downloadable Materials
-  Files from your Computer
-  Videos (From Kaltura, Vimeo, YouTube, Storyline, and others)
-  Video Transcripts
-  Assignments
-  Self-Assessments
-  Discussion Forums
-  External Links
-  Surveys
-  Timelines
-  Images and Video Reels

**You can add content from four different sources.**

-  **Add Content from within the NextThought Application:**

   -  Content created by our NextThought team can be added to the platform
   for placement in a lesson. Content developed or designed by
   NextThought includes readings, videos, discussions, timelines,
   surveys, self-assessments, and assignments. Contact your Project
   Manager to add interactive content to your course.

-  **Add Content from your Computer:**

   -  You can also upload almost any type of file into a lesson including
   Microsoft Office files, PDFs, Images, Zip files, and more.

   .. note::  Most of these file types will be downloadable for students from the application, however, if your file is a PDF, it can be viewed within the platform itself and will allow notes.

-  **Link to Content:**

   -  You can add URL links to your lesson. When a student clicks on this
   type of content, it will open a new tab in their browser window.

-  **Author your own Content:**

    -  NextThought allows you to create your own course assignments (see “Create an Assignment”) as well as in-application readings (see “Create a Reading”)!

Add a File from your Computer
---------------------------------

File uploads are content files that you upload from your computer into
lessons within your course. You can upload most any file, including:

-  Microsoft Office files (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.)
-  PDFs
-  Images (.jpg, .gif, .png)
-  Zip files
-  And others such as .xml, .odt, .rtf, .epub, .mp4, .txt

.. note:: Please note: Only PDFs will display within the application itself. Students can read PDF files within the course and add comments and notes. All other file types will have to be downloaded by students for off-platform viewing. Students will need the appropriate software to open the file.

In order to add content to a section from your computer, follow the
steps below:

#. While in Edit Mode, click on “+Add Content” in the section you want to edit.

   .. warning:: Please note: if you don’t see “+Add Content” you need to first add a section to the lesson page (see the above section on Adding sections to lessons).

able to see the assignment.

.. warning:: This state is only available for authored assignments. Learn more in Part III Create an Assignment.

4. **Due Date (due date)**

Assignments are still available once the due date passes, but will be
marked as late in the gradebook if completed after the date has passed.
