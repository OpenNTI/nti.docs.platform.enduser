**Visible in Catalog**

The "Visible in Catalog" field allows you to toggle course visibility within the course catalog. 

- **Off:**
  This option will keep the course private. This means that the course will not show up in the public course catalog. No one will be able to enroll in the course unless you provide them with the course redemption code.
  
- **On:**
  This will allow the course to display in the course catalog. This means that when a site user clicks on the course catalog, the course will display and the learner can view basic course information and enroll in the course.

**Preview Mode**

The "Preview Mode" defines when the course becomes available for learners to begin.

- **Preview Mode On:**
  This option sets the course to course preview mode, meaning that users can only view Course Info but cannot view course content.
  
- **Preview Mode Off:**
  This option allows the course to be fully available to users.
  
- **Based on Start Date:**
  This option sets the course to be in course preview mode until the defined start date and time, at which time it will then become fully available to users.

..  note:: By default the course will be in **Preview Mode On** and will need to be either switched to **Preview Mode Off** or **Based on Start Date** for users to begin the course. 


Basic Course Information
--------------------------
Basic course information includes the course ID, title, description, and tags. This information will display to learners.

**Course Identifier**

**Course Title**

**About this Course**

Describe your course. This description will help learners decide if they wish to enroll in the course.

**Categories**

Tag courses with one or multiple tags (e.g., “English Literature”). These tags will create categories within the course catalog, and allow learners to search available courses by category.
