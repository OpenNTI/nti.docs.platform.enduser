Add Content
================

Adding content to your course essentially follows the same few steps with the exception of more extensive tools such as uploading files and building readings and assignments.

.. note:: Before adding content, make sure you've already build your course outline (units, lessons, sections). If you haven't done so, please visit https://help.nextthought.com/editorguide/course.html.

**To begin adding content to your course,**

1. Navigate to the "Lessons" tab.
2. Click on the "Start Editing" button in the bottom right-hand corner.

   .. note:: If you do not see this button, you are not in an Instructor, Editor, or Admin account.
   
3. Within the section you want to add content, click "Add Content."

4. Select the content type, fill out required information, follow prompts, and "Add to Lesson."

For more information regarding specific content types and adding them to your course, please continue to the specific content-named instructions following this page.

Require Content
================

Require certain activities in your course to track learner progress and award credit and certificates. 

.. note:: See more regarding credit here https://help.nextthought.com/editorguide/setup.html#course-credit and certificates here https://help.nextthought.com/editorguide/setup.html#advanced-completion-and-certificates.

By default, when content is placed in a lesson, it is “optional.” While in Edit Mode, instructors, editors, and assistants can mark certain course materials as “Required" by clicking on the dropdown menu on the content piece itself on the Lessons page. You must be in Edit Mode to view this dropdown menu.

When a resource is marked as “Required,” a label will appear next to the content on the Lessons page.
