Add Content
================

Adding content to your course essentially follows the same few steps with the exception of more extensive tools such as uploading files and building readings and assignments.

.. note:: Before adding content, make sure you've already build your course outline (units, lessons, sections). If you haven't done so, please visit https://help.nextthought.com/editorguide/course.html.

To begin adding content to your course,

1. Navigate to the "Lessons" tab.
2. Click on the "Start Editing" button in the bottom right-hand corner.

   .. note:: If you do not see this button, you are not in an Instructor, Editor, or Admin account.
   
3. Within the section you want to add content, click "Add Content."
4. Select the content type, fill out required information, follow prompts, and "Add to Lesson."

For more information regarding specific content types and adding them to your course, please continue in this guide to the sections named by content types.
