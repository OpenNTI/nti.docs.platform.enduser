Add a Self-Assessment
----------------------------

Self-assessments are quizzes that students can take for their own
self-evaluation. As a self-check, no grades are posted to the
gradebook. Students can take a self-assessment multiple times, and
solutions are available to view after each attempt.

In order to add a self-assessment to your course, your Project Manager
will need to upload it to your course files. Once your assessment is
available to you in your course files, follow the steps below to select
and place it into a lesson.

#. While in Edit Mode, click on “+Add Content” in the section you want to edit.

.. warning:: Please note: if you don’t see the “+Add Content” banner, you need to first add a section to the lesson page (see the above section on Adding Sections to Lessons). 

2. In the “Choose a content type” popup, click on “Self Assessment.”
