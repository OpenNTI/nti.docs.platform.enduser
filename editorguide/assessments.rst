Self Assessments
======================

Authoring Tools coming soon!

Self-assessments are only for self-evaluation. Learners can take a self-assessment multiple times, and solutions are available to view after each attempt. No formalized grade is posted for self-assessments.

Add Self-Assessment
=====================

.. note:: In order to add a self-assessment to your course, your project manager will need to upload it to your course files. Please reach out to your project manager for further instruction.

Once your project manager has informed you that your assessment is available in your course files, follow the steps below to select and place it into a lesson:

1. While in Edit Mode, click on “+Add Content” in the section you want to edit.
