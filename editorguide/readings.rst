Readings
======================

Our authoring tools allow you to create a reading to place within your
course lesson. Unlike an embedded text such as a PDF, an authored
reading allows students to comment inline with the text and highlight.

Create a Reading
----------------
Creating a reading allows you to offer a more dynamic experience for your learners. A reading allows learners to comment inline with their text, markup images, watch videos, and more.

Described below are two methods to create a reading. One is optimized for immediate placement in a lesson, and the other is optimized to create a reading to place later.

1. Create a Reading for Immediate Lesson Placement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While within your course’s Lessons View, enter "Edit Mode" by clicking "Start Editing" in the bottom right-hand corner.

2. Navigate to the lesson in which you'd like to place your reading.
  
3. Locate the section in which you'd like to place your reading, or create a new section.
  
4. Click "+Add Content" 
  
5. Select "From Catalog" in the "Choose a content type" window.

  .. note:: In this window, you can find all of the readings created by NextThought or authored by you.

6. Click "Create Content" in the upper left-hand corner.
  
7. Add a title, author, and description for your course. The latter two are optional. You may also add a thumbnail to your reading by clicking on the blue thumbnail button. This is the image that will display on your lessons page.
  
8. Click "Add to Lesson." This will now navigate you into the reading editing view. 

9. Continue to Step 5 in the section below.


2. Create a Reading to Place Later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While within your course’s Lessons View, enter "Edit Mode" by clicking "Start Editing" in the bottom right-hand corner.

    .. image:: images/createnewreadingdescription.png

   **Reading Thumbnail**

   Click on the image to the left of the title and description to open the Resource Viewer and select or upload an image for the reading. This image can be changed before the reading is placed into a course.
  
   **Reading Title**

   This will name the reading within the Resource folder. The title can be changed before being placed into a course.

   **Reading Description**

   The description will offer a description for the reading that's viewable on the Lessons page. The description can be changed before being placed into a course.

   **Reading Feature Types**
   
   These "types" allow you to add features into the reading, including a numbered or bulleted list, and photos or videos. Click on a type to add it into your reading. For more details on adding a photo or video to your reading, see "Adding Additional Reading Features" below.
   
   .. image:: images/createnewreadingstyles.png
   
   **Text Headers**
   
   Choose between “Title Text,” “Section Text,” and “Paragraph Headline Text” to organize your text.
   
   **Links**
   
   Add hyperlinked text into your reading by highlighting the text in which you'd like to link and clicking the link option on your editing toolbar. Add the URL and Display Text, and click "Save."
   
   **Text Styles**
   
   Choose Bold, Italics, or Underline to emphasize text.

6. Select the blue “Publish” button in the bottom right-hand corner to open the publish state flyout. Then, select “Publish” in the flyout in order to publish the text and make it available for placement within a lesson, or navigate away from the reading without publishing to save it as a draft to return to later.

.. note:: Once a text is “published” you will be able to find it in the reading catalog when adding content to a lesson. In other words, “Publishing” your reading doesn’t make it instantly viewable to students. You must first place it within a lesson.
